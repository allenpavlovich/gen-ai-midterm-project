    "| **2. Built `move_markdown_subset.py`** | *Scans* `/data/markdown/` → *moves* only matching files to `/data/markdown_subset/` using atomic `shutil.move`; prints a JSON list of moved files. | Creates a reproducible, source-controlled filter; no manual cleanup later. |\n",
    "| **3. Two-stage pruning run** | **Stage 1 (filename filter)** → 999 files copied <br> **Stage 2 (content keywords)** → 675 files kept | Stage 2 drops empty or off-topic pages that slipped through by slug alone. |\n",
    "| **4. Audited skipped files** | Reviewed 324 skipped markdowns (news, insights, outreach, “about” pages, etc.). None contain rubric-critical facts; only `about_contact.*md` might be nice for contact info. | Confirms we aren’t losing required content, keeps index small and precise. |\n",
    "| **5. Rubric coverage check** | Verified that the retained set includes: <br>• Tuition `$5,967 / $71,604` <br>• Scholarships `DSI Scholarship` & `ADS Alumni Scholarship` <br>• English minimums `TOEFL 102 / IELTS 7` | Guarantees the bot can answer the three ground-truth questions with citations. |\n",
    "| **6. Optional tweak** | Add a stem like `_about_contact` and rerun the script if we want the bot to answer “How do I contact the program?” | Polishing only; not required for the midterm. |\n",

    "* **Lean corpus (675 md pages)** → faster embedding, cheaper storage, higher retrieval precision.  \n",

      "# Jan Mrozowski’s Path from Industry Professional to Teaching in the MS in Applied Data Science Program\n",
      "\n",
      "!For Jan Mrozowski (MSADS ‘19), the journey to UChicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program was unexpected and, at first, unplanned. Originally from Eastern Europe and having lived in various countries, Mrozowski returned from Australia in late 2013 to begin the next chapter of his career in the United States. His first job offer with GE came with an intriguing opportunity. “I got three job offers, and all of them paid similar amounts of money, but GE told me that they pay 100% tuition at the school of my choice. So I was like, okay, and I joined GE and the University of Chicago at the same time,” he recalls, describing his entry into the newly launched program.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Academic Beginnings and Real-World Experience**\n",
      "\n",
      "With over a decade of experience in marketing analytics, Mrozowski wasn’t new to data science when he entered the program. He started the Data Science function at Woolworths, Australia’s largest retailer, before the term “Data Science” was widely used, holding the title of Business Support Manager. Later, at GE, he led marketing analytics for the Sam’s Club credit card portfolio, adding valuable hands-on experience to his expertise. While he was already well-versed in analytics, the program helped refine his skills in areas like data engineering and cloud computing. “That helped me a lot in my career since I joined the program,” he says. “It definitely improved some of my skills, especially in the area of data engineering and cloud computing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **The Accidental Teacher: From Student to Professor**\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrozowski’s journey into teaching was as unplanned as his entry into the program. While collaborating with fellow students on an assignment, a group member—who also taught at another university—noticed his expertise and encouraged him to consider teaching. This led to his first teaching role at Benedictine University in Naperville while he was still a student. His passion for teaching grew from there. “When I was talking to professors at UChicago, they were like, ‘Why don’t you TA?’ So I thought, why not?” he shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "This early teaching experience eventually inspired him to pursue a PhD in economics in Poland, sponsored by the National Bank of his native country. Upon returning to Chicago, Mrozowski enrolled in a consulting class taught by [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/) and [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/), who were part of the new leadership of the program. He appreciated the insights and perspectives they brought to the curriculum, noting how the program continued to evolve with fresh approaches. Since then, Mrozowski has served as a TA for multiple UChicago [Applied Data Science courses](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/), including *Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics*, *Big Data and Cloud Computing*, and *Time Series Analysis and Forecasting*, among others. Reflecting on his experiences, he muses, “If I didn’t go to Europe, maybe I would be teaching by now as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **A Love for Data Engineering**\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the courses Mrozowski has TA’d, [Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/) stands out as a favorite. “I think data engineering is grossly underappreciated,” he explains. “Everybody’s focusing on model development, but it takes a lot of effort to prepare the data.” He shares an example from his current role as head of the risk department at Flex Shopper, where a recent intern was surprised by the complexity and time required for data preparation. “One piece of feedback she had was that she never understood how much time it takes to prepare the data for modeling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrozowski emphasizes that data engineering demands a deep understanding of data structures and access methods, which are critical for extracting and preparing data in the right format. He sees it as an essential foundation for success in the field. At every opportunity, he hires interns and employees from the program, recognizing their strong foundational skills and readiness to tackle real-world challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Supporting Students Through Technical Challenges**\n",
      "\n",
      "For Mrozowski, one of the most rewarding aspects of being a TA is helping students overcome technical hurdles. “Being able to help students when they say, ‘Yes, it finally works,’” he says. Whether troubleshooting code or guiding students through challenging concepts, he takes pride in enabling their success. “You wouldn’t believe how much time I sometimes spend with data engineering students when there is a little-known issue,” he says. From ensuring compatibility with Apple’s latest processors to addressing cloud computing problems, his support often extends beyond the curriculum.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Advice for New Students: Focus on Foundations and Networking**\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked what advice he would give to incoming students, Mrozowski underscores the importance of foundational courses. “Definitely pay more attention to data engineering and big data classes, because they will set you apart and prepare for success,” he advises. He also emphasizes networking, encouraging students to attend alumni events and build connections within the program’s professional network.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Looking Ahead**\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrozowski’s unconventional path through the MS in Applied Data Science program has led him to fulfilling roles as a TA, mentor, and leader in his field. His journey—spanning multiple countries and professional milestones—highlights the importance of embracing unexpected opportunities. Mrozowski remains dedicated to supporting and inspiring students, reflecting his commitment to advancing the next generation of data science professionals.\n",

These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n",

      "\n",
      "    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems.

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "\n",
      "    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation.

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

It covers three pillars in MLOps: software engineering such as software architecture, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and data versioning; model engineering such as AutoML and A/B experimentation; and deployment engineering such as docker containers and model monitoring. The course focuses on best practices in the industry that are critical to enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects. Having completed this course, a student understands the machine learning lifecycle and what it takes to go from ideation to operationalization in an enterprise environment. Furthermore, students get exposure to state-of-the-art MLOps platforms such as allegro, xpresso, Dataiku, LityxIQ, DataRobot, AWS Sagemaker, and technologies such as gitHub, Jenkins, slack, docker, and kubernetes.\n",
      "  * Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing \n",
      "\n",
      "    Extracting actionable insights from unstructured text and designing cognitive applications have become significant areas of application for analytics. Students in this course will learn foundations of natural language processing, including: concept extraction; text summarization and topic modeling; part of speech tagging; named entity recognition; semantic roles and sentiment analysis. For advanced NLP applications, we will focus on feature extraction from unstructured text, including word and paragraph embedding and representing words and paragraphs as vectors. For cognitive analytics section of the course, students will practice designing question answering systems with intent classification, semantic knowledge extraction and reasoning under uncertainty. Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding.\n",
      "  * Real Time Intelligent Systems \n",
      "\n",
      "    Developing end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students. The course focuses on python and is tailored for students with basic programming knowledge in python. The course is partially project based. During the first three sessions, we will review basic python concepts and then learn more advanced python and the ways to use python to handle large data flows. The later sessions are project based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems.\n",
      "  * Reinforcement Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "    This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\n",
      "  * Supply Chain Optimization \n",
      "\n",
      "    “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain. Students will also learn how to optimize the performance of the Supply Chain from the lens of multiple related disciplines including: Sales Forecasting, Warehousing/Inventory Management, Promotion, Pricing, Logistics Network Optimization, Freight Cost Management, Manufacturing, Retail POS Information, Ecommerce, Consumer Data, and Product Design/Packaging. After completing this course, you will be prepared to work in any of the numerous specialty areas possible in the world of Supply Chain Management.\n",

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems.

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "In their remarks, speakers emphasized the program’s evolution over the past decade and its bright future. Alison Ossyra celebrated the accomplishments of alumni, while Ka Yee Lee shared a poignant quote from a [Chicago Maroon 2013 article](https://chicagomaroon.com/17787/news/graham-offers-analytics-degree/). The quote, reflecting on the program’s inception, noted, “It is rare that a statistics program will venture beyond the classroom setting to integrate industry data sets or case studies in the curriculum or provide students with opportunities to interact with colleagues or potential employers outside of academia.” Greg Green spoke to the program’s rapid growth, with over 550 current students and 1,400 alumni, and David Uminsky underscored the importance of the Data Science Institute’s collaboration with the program. Alumni representatives Elijah Ampo and Kshitij Mittal encouraged graduates to stay connected and involved.\n",

      "The success of the program is evident not only in the numbers but also in the remarkable impact it has had on its alumni over the past decade. Jorge Argueta, a 2020 graduate of the program, shared a piece of advice for prospective students considering applying: “Don’t think too much about it; just do it! It has transformed my career since I moved to Chicago and was part of the program. All the knowledge I learned in the program and brought back to my organization has helped me file my first patent, which was approved.”\n",

      "The Capstone Showcase represents the pinnacle of the student experience in the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program. This event merges academic knowledge with practical, real-world challenges across various key research areas. This year, 37 capstone teams presented their projects, leading all phases of problem-solving with the support of faculty, staff, and industry experts. While projects spanned numerous industries, data types, and methodologies, all teams exhibited professionalism, pride, and commitment to excellence. The judges observed that the Showcase featured a diverse array of research-focused, industry-generated, and independent student projects spanning healthcare, marketing, supply chain, financial services, and more.\n",

      "Paula Payton is the Head of the Center for Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MInDS) at Deloitte Research & Insights. She also happened to be a distinguished industry judge for the Autumn 2024 Capstone Showcase, her third year running. Impressed with the caliber of the graduate student presentations, Payton said, “Talk about pushing back the frontiers in applied AI…. talented students presented unbelievably original solutions to classic industry problems. That was exciting for me to see as a professional in the field and also someone who cares very deeply about data science and AI education.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the standout projects was “Once Upon,” a storytelling app that uses AI to craft personalized stories for children based on their imagination and preferences. The team, consisting of Hima Cheruvu, Nia Gangar, Rishika Ravindran, and Christian Piantanida, shared their inspiration: “Our inspiration came from a moment of pure frustration and imagination. A few years ago, one of our team members’ then 4-year-old neighbor tried to get Amazon Alexa to tell her a story about her favorite princess going to swimming class. Alexa couldn’t quite deliver, and her neighbor was so frustrated that she started yelling at Alexa. That experience stuck with her—it showed how much children want to hear stories that are unique and personally meaningful to them, yet existing technology struggled to meet that need.” The student team wanted to create a tool that inspires creativity while empowering kids to be part of the storytelling process.\n",

      "MS in Applied Data Science students deliver impactful solutions through capstone projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Capstone Showcase represents the pinnacle of the student experience in the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program. This event merges academic knowledge with practical, real-world challenges across various key research areas. This year, 37 capstone teams presented their projects, leading all phases of problem-solving with the support of faculty, staff, and industry experts. While projects spanned numerous industries, data types, and methodologies, all teams exhibited professionalism, pride, and commitment to excellence. The judges observed that the Showcase featured a diverse array of research-focused, industry-generated, and independent student projects spanning healthcare, marketing, supply chain, financial services, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paula Payton is the Head of the Center for Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MInDS) at Deloitte Research & Insights. She also happened to be a distinguished industry judge for the Autumn 2024 Capstone Showcase, her third year running. Impressed with the caliber of the graduate student presentations, Payton said, “Talk about pushing back the frontiers in applied AI…. talented students presented unbelievably original solutions to classic industry problems. That was exciting for me to see as a professional in the field and also someone who cares very deeply about data science and AI education.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the standout projects was “Once Upon,” a storytelling app that uses AI to craft personalized stories for children based on their imagination and preferences. The team, consisting of Hima Cheruvu, Nia Gangar, Rishika Ravindran, and Christian Piantanida, shared their inspiration: “Our inspiration came from a moment of pure frustration and imagination. A few years ago, one of our team members’ then 4-year-old neighbor tried to get Amazon Alexa to tell her a story about her favorite princess going to swimming class. Alexa couldn’t quite deliver, and her neighbor was so frustrated that she started yelling at Alexa. That experience stuck with her—it showed how much children want to hear stories that are unique and personally meaningful to them, yet existing technology struggled to meet that need.” The student team wanted to create a tool that inspires creativity while empowering kids to be part of the storytelling process.\n",

      "**Sampling Research**\n",
      "\n",
      "Students in the MS-Applied Data Science program now have a research-focused option for their capstone experience. At a time when collaborations between industry and academia are vital for innovation and unlocking new sources of value, applied data scientists are broadening their perspective and deepening their skillsets by gaining exposure to the research side of the discipline.\n",
      "\n",
      "The University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/how-to-apply/) has taken an important step to meet this demand by developing a new capstone track for students eager to try their hands at research.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the [capstone experience](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/) has traditionally involved working closely with industry partners to solve real-world business problems, the research capstone offers students an opportunity to collaborate with faculty on a leading-edge area of data science where methodologies and applications are still actively being investigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The area of research is the key,” says [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/), an associate clinical professor at UChicago who spearheaded the MS in Applied Data Science’s research capstone track. “We’re not conducting research on already well-studied areas but on the newest technologies where industry applications are still being worked out and discovered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The first batch of research projects focused on generative AI, an area that Pamuksuz says is calling out for research right now and full of opportunities for students to gain experience in research design.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our goal is to be as up-to-the-minute as possible when it comes to teaching and sharing content with our students,” he says. “GenAI is an area still full of open questions and we saw that a research-oriented approach where faculty work directly with students as they review papers, conduct experiments, and present at academic conferences would be the best way for students to understand these technologies at a fundamental level.”\n",
      "\n",
      "**Connecting Academia to Industry**\n",
      "\n",
      "For his part, Pamuksuz has straddled research and industry throughout his career. While earning his PhD in machine learning, he collaborated with professors in finance, marketing, and healthcare information systems to understand how these abstract methodologies connect to other disciplines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can do data science and use machine learning tools on virtually anything,” he says. “That’s what really caught my eye: The research side and the applied side are in constant dialogue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having led data science teams at several Fortune 500 companies and co-founded the machine-learning company Inference Analytics, Pamuksuz also continues to do his own research, attend conferences, and publish in journals. He says it gives him an advantage when teaching in the Applied Data Science classroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll show students how particular GenAI tools are being applied today, but then I’ll also highlight how the area is a live research area that’s still open to exploration and being looked at from various angles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first round of research projects, Pamuksuz and other faculty selected healthcare as the domain area. With solid data sets, innumerable potential use cases, and a positive social factor, the domain gives students an ideal instrument to more deeply understand and operationalize the foundational concepts driving the latest GenAI transformer models.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our goal was to work with students and get them to understand these models on the most basic levels, down even to figuring out what each single neuron is doing and how they’re interacting with each other and the specific journey leading to the output. These areas are still very poorly understood today.”\n",
      "\n",
      "**PhD-Lite Experience**\n",
      "\n",
      "For their research capstone project, Andrew Alvarez, Mary Erikson, and Tegan Keigher leveraged the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate results for CT radiology reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "With up to fifty percent of radiologists’s time spent drafting reports today, transformer models that can automate the documenting process have the potential to save time and reduce the stress responsible for increasing burnout in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having started their project in early 2023—just months after the groundbreaking release of ChatGPT—the team was particularly excited to dive into an area that was so timely and full of potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s been really incredible to focus on such a central topic in the world right now and dissect the nuts and bolts taking place inside it,” says Erikson, an analytical lead at Google.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At first the idea of building our own transformer model might’ve felt a little like we were biting off more than we could chew, but through reading the key research papers, learning in class, and talking with each other and Utku, we were able to get a handle on this new area and connect it with what we’d learned already in the program.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alvarez, an engagement manager at United Airlines, says that “doing something research-based gave us an entirely new experience, one that allowed us to pick up a different sort of skillset that’s still amenable to the workplace. It was something like a PhD-lite experience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The capstone-related work has also helped me guide others taking their first steps into using transformer models,” Alvarez adds. “Automating areas that are putting a strain on our teams allows us to focus on the work that matters. That’s where I think these technologies will really shine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "**Frontiers of Research**\n",
      "\n",
      "A critical learning experience arrived when the team presented their research at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) as part of the [Conference on Machine Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CMIMI)](https://siim.org/learning-events/events/cmimi/).\n",
      "\n",
      "The selective research-focused conference gave them the opportunity to mingle with top experts in the field and view firsthand what was taking place on the frontiers of research.  \n",
      "Perhaps most significant were the questions the team received in response to their presentation.\n",

      "“They asked us if we’d tried this approach, or looked at it in this way, or pre-processed data in that way,” says Keigher, a lead data scientist at United Airlines. “Learning about these other purely research-based approaches sparked ideas for us and got us thinking about how we could improve our project and test out different avenues.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The team is now deepening their project by incorporating what they learned at the conference. Once they finalize their results, the plan is to submit their work to the ultimate research test: a peer-reviewed publication.\n",

      "For their research capstone project, Andrew Alvarez, Mary Erikson, and Tegan Keigher leveraged the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate results for CT radiology reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "With up to fifty percent of radiologists’s time spent drafting reports today, transformer models that can automate the documenting process have the potential to save time and reduce the stress responsible for increasing burnout in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having started their project in early 2023—just months after the groundbreaking release of ChatGPT—the team was particularly excited to dive into an area that was so timely and full of potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s been really incredible to focus on such a central topic in the world right now and dissect the nuts and bolts taking place inside it,” says Erikson, an analytical lead at Google.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At first the idea of building our own transformer model might’ve felt a little like we were biting off more than we could chew, but through reading the key research papers, learning in class, and talking with each other and Utku, we were able to get a handle on this new area and connect it with what we’d learned already in the program.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alvarez, an engagement manager at United Airlines, says that “doing something research-based gave us an entirely new experience, one that allowed us to pick up a different sort of skillset that’s still amenable to the workplace. It was something like a PhD-lite experience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The capstone-related work has also helped me guide others taking their first steps into using transformer models,” Alvarez adds. “Automating areas that are putting a strain on our teams allows us to focus on the work that matters. That’s where I think these technologies will really shine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "**Frontiers of Research**\n",
      "\n",
      "A critical learning experience arrived when the team presented their research at [Johns Hopkins University(https://www.jhu.edu/) as part of the [Conference on Machine Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CMIMI)(https://siim.org/learning-events/events/cmimi/).\n",
      "\n",
      "The selective research-focused conference gave them the opportunity to mingle with top experts in the field and view firsthand what was taking place on the frontiers of research.  \n",
      "Perhaps most significant were the questions the team received in response to their presentation.\n",

      "“They asked us if we’d tried this approach, or looked at it in this way, or pre-processed data in that way,” says Keigher, a lead data scientist at United Airlines. “Learning about these other purely research-based approaches sparked ideas for us and got us thinking about how we could improve our project and test out different avenues.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The team is now deepening their project by incorporating what they learned at the conference. Once they finalize their results, the plan is to submit their work to the ultimate research test: a peer-reviewed publication.\n",

This trip was a reward for their completion of the Career Course, a class designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge to navigate the job market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day started with a fun icebreaker – students introduced themselves and shared their favorite Google product. The range was impressive, from everyday tools such as Google Calendar to cutting-edge data science solutions like the recently launched large language model Gemini. Next, students got an insider’s perspective through presentations from seven Googlers, each detailing their typical workday experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highlight for many students was access to [Google Labs](https://labs.google), a digital playground for experimenting with the latest AI tools and testing hypotheses. Students explored projects such as Generative AI with Vertex AI and Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Vertex AI Gemini API.\n",
      "\n",
      "To wrap up the visit, students toured the Google office, complete with well-stocked snack rooms, an arcade for work breaks, and a unique workspace – an old CTA train car on the rooftop, equipped with Wi-Fi!\n",

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "\n",
      "    This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\n",
      "  * Supply Chain Optimization \n",
      "\n",
      "    “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain. Students will also learn how to optimize the performance of the Supply Chain from the lens of multiple related disciplines including: Sales Forecasting, Warehousing/Inventory Management, Promotion, Pricing, Logistics Network Optimization, Freight Cost Management, Manufacturing, Retail POS Information, Ecommerce, Consumer Data, and Product Design/Packaging. After completing this course, you will be prepared to work in any of the numerous specialty areas possible in the world of Supply Chain Management.\n",

These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n",

      "# Jan Mrozowski’s Path from Industry Professional to Teaching in the MS in Applied Data Science Program\n",
      "\n",
      "!For Jan Mrozowski (MSADS ‘19), the journey to UChicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program was unexpected and, at first, unplanned. Originally from Eastern Europe and having lived in various countries, Mrozowski returned from Australia in late 2013 to begin the next chapter of his career in the United States. His first job offer with GE came with an intriguing opportunity. “I got three job offers, and all of them paid similar amounts of money, but GE told me that they pay 100% tuition at the school of my choice. So I was like, okay, and I joined GE and the University of Chicago at the same time,” he recalls, describing his entry into the newly launched program.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Academic Beginnings and Real-World Experience**\n",
      "\n",
      "With over a decade of experience in marketing analytics, Mrozowski wasn’t new to data science when he entered the program. He started the Data Science function at Woolworths, Australia’s largest retailer, before the term “Data Science” was widely used, holding the title of Business Support Manager. Later, at GE, he led marketing analytics for the Sam’s Club credit card portfolio, adding valuable hands-on experience to his expertise. While he was already well-versed in analytics, the program helped refine his skills in areas like data engineering and cloud computing. “That helped me a lot in my career since I joined the program,” he says. “It definitely improved some of my skills, especially in the area of data engineering and cloud computing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **The Accidental Teacher: From Student to Professor**\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrozowski’s journey into teaching was as unplanned as his entry into the program. While collaborating with fellow students on an assignment, a group member—who also taught at another university—noticed his expertise and encouraged him to consider teaching. This led to his first teaching role at Benedictine University in Naperville while he was still a student. His passion for teaching grew from there. “When I was talking to professors at UChicago, they were like, ‘Why don’t you TA?’ So I thought, why not?” he shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "This early teaching experience eventually inspired him to pursue a PhD in economics in Poland, sponsored by the National Bank of his native country. Upon returning to Chicago, Mrozowski enrolled in a consulting class taught by [Greg Green(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/) and [Don Patchell(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/), who were part of the new leadership of the program. He appreciated the insights and perspectives they brought to the curriculum, noting how the program continued to evolve with fresh approaches. Since then, Mrozowski has served as a TA for multiple UChicago [Applied Data Science courses(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/), including *Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics*, *Big Data and Cloud Computing*, and *Time Series Analysis and Forecasting*, among others. Reflecting on his experiences, he muses, “If I didn’t go to Europe, maybe I would be teaching by now as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **A Love for Data Engineering**\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the courses Mrozowski has TA’d, [Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/) stands out as a favorite. “I think data engineering is grossly underappreciated,” he explains. “Everybody’s focusing on model development, but it takes a lot of effort to prepare the data.” He shares an example from his current role as head of the risk department at Flex Shopper, where a recent intern was surprised by the complexity and time required for data preparation. “One piece of feedback she had was that she never understood how much time it takes to prepare the data for modeling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrozowski emphasizes that data engineering demands a deep understanding of data structures and access methods, which are critical for extracting and preparing data in the right format. He sees it as an essential foundation for success in the field. At every opportunity, he hires interns and employees from the program, recognizing their strong foundational skills and readiness to tackle real-world challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Supporting Students Through Technical Challenges**\n",
      "\n",
      "For Mrozowski, one of the most rewarding aspects of being a TA is helping students overcome technical hurdles. “Being able to help students when they say, ‘Yes, it finally works,’” he says. Whether troubleshooting code or guiding students through challenging concepts, he takes pride in enabling their success. “You wouldn’t believe how much time I sometimes spend with data engineering students when there is a little-known issue,” he says.

      "# Jan Mrozowski’s Path from Industry Professional to Teaching in the MS in Applied Data Science Program\n",
      "\n",
      "!For Jan Mrozowski (MSADS ‘19), the journey to UChicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program was unexpected and, at first, unplanned. Originally from Eastern Europe and having lived in various countries, Mrozowski returned from Australia in late 2013 to begin the next chapter of his career in the United States. His first job offer with GE came with an intriguing opportunity. “I got three job offers, and all of them paid similar amounts of money, but GE told me that they pay 100% tuition at the school of my choice. So I was like, okay, and I joined GE and the University of Chicago at the same time,” he recalls, describing his entry into the newly launched program.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Academic Beginnings and Real-World Experience**\n",
      "\n",
      "With over a decade of experience in marketing analytics, Mrozowski wasn’t new to data science when he entered the program. He started the Data Science function at Woolworths, Australia’s largest retailer, before the term “Data Science” was widely used, holding the title of Business Support Manager. Later, at GE, he led marketing analytics for the Sam’s Club credit card portfolio, adding valuable hands-on experience to his expertise. While he was already well-versed in analytics, the program helped refine his skills in areas like data engineering and cloud computing. “That helped me a lot in my career since I joined the program,” he says. “It definitely improved some of my skills, especially in the area of data engineering and cloud computing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **The Accidental Teacher: From Student to Professor**\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrozowski’s journey into teaching was as unplanned as his entry into the program. While collaborating with fellow students on an assignment, a group member—who also taught at another university—noticed his expertise and encouraged him to consider teaching. This led to his first teaching role at Benedictine University in Naperville while he was still a student. His passion for teaching grew from there. “When I was talking to professors at UChicago, they were like, ‘Why don’t you TA?’ So I thought, why not?” he shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "This early teaching experience eventually inspired him to pursue a PhD in economics in Poland, sponsored by the National Bank of his native country. Upon returning to Chicago, Mrozowski enrolled in a consulting class taught by [Greg Green(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/) and [Don Patchell(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/), who were part of the new leadership of the program. He appreciated the insights and perspectives they brought to the curriculum, noting how the program continued to evolve with fresh approaches. Since then, Mrozowski has served as a TA for multiple UChicago [Applied Data Science courses(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/), including *Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics*, *Big Data and Cloud Computing*, and *Time Series Analysis and Forecasting*, among others. Reflecting on his experiences, he muses, “If I didn’t go to Europe, maybe I would be teaching by now as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **A Love for Data Engineering**\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the courses Mrozowski has TA’d, [Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/) stands out as a favorite. “I think data engineering is grossly underappreciated,” he explains. “Everybody’s focusing on model development, but it takes a lot of effort to prepare the data.” He shares an example from his current role as head of the risk department at Flex Shopper, where a recent intern was surprised by the complexity and time required for data preparation. “One piece of feedback she had was that she never understood how much time it takes to prepare the data for modeling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrozowski emphasizes that data engineering demands a deep understanding of data structures and access methods, which are critical for extracting and preparing data in the right format. He sees it as an essential foundation for success in the field. At every opportunity, he hires interns and employees from the program, recognizing their strong foundational skills and readiness to tackle real-world challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Supporting Students Through Technical Challenges**\n",
      "\n",
      "For Mrozowski, one of the most rewarding aspects of being a TA is helping students overcome technical hurdles. “Being able to help students when they say, ‘Yes, it finally works,’” he says. Whether troubleshooting code or guiding students through challenging concepts, he takes pride in enabling their success. “You wouldn’t believe how much time I sometimes spend with data engineering students when there is a little-known issue,” he says. From ensuring compatibility with Apple’s latest processors to addressing cloud computing problems, his support often extends beyond the curriculum.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Advice for New Students: Focus on Foundations and Networking**\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked what advice he would give to incoming students, Mrozowski underscores the importance of foundational courses. “Definitely pay more attention to data engineering and big data classes, because they will set you apart and prepare for success,” he advises. He also emphasizes networking, encouraging students to attend alumni events and build connections within the program’s professional network.\n",

      "\n",
      "    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems.

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture.

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

      "The Capstone Showcase represents the pinnacle of the student experience in the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program. This event merges academic knowledge with practical, real-world challenges across various key research areas. This year, 37 capstone teams presented their projects, leading all phases of problem-solving with the support of faculty, staff, and industry experts. While projects spanned numerous industries, data types, and methodologies, all teams exhibited professionalism, pride, and commitment to excellence. The judges observed that the Showcase featured a diverse array of research-focused, industry-generated, and independent student projects spanning healthcare, marketing, supply chain, financial services, and more.\n",

      "Paula Payton is the Head of the Center for Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MInDS) at Deloitte Research & Insights. She also happened to be a distinguished industry judge for the Autumn 2024 Capstone Showcase, her third year running. Impressed with the caliber of the graduate student presentations, Payton said, “Talk about pushing back the frontiers in applied AI…. talented students presented unbelievably original solutions to classic industry problems. That was exciting for me to see as a professional in the field and also someone who cares very deeply about data science and AI education.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the standout projects was “Once Upon,” a storytelling app that uses AI to craft personalized stories for children based on their imagination and preferences. The team, consisting of Hima Cheruvu, Nia Gangar, Rishika Ravindran, and Christian Piantanida, shared their inspiration: “Our inspiration came from a moment of pure frustration and imagination. A few years ago, one of our team members’ then 4-year-old neighbor tried to get Amazon Alexa to tell her a story about her favorite princess going to swimming class. Alexa couldn’t quite deliver, and her neighbor was so frustrated that she started yelling at Alexa. That experience stuck with her—it showed how much children want to hear stories that are unique and personally meaningful to them, yet existing technology struggled to meet that need.” The student team wanted to create a tool that inspires creativity while empowering kids to be part of the storytelling process.\n",

      "The University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/how-to-apply/) has taken an important step to meet this demand by developing a new capstone track for students eager to try their hands at research.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the [capstone experience(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/) has traditionally involved working closely with industry partners to solve real-world business problems, the research capstone offers students an opportunity to collaborate with faculty on a leading-edge area of data science where methodologies and applications are still actively being investigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The area of research is the key,” says [Utku Pamuksuz(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/), an associate clinical professor at UChicago who spearheaded the MS in Applied Data Science’s research capstone track. “We’re not conducting research on already well-studied areas but on the newest technologies where industry applications are still being worked out and discovered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The first batch of research projects focused on generative AI, an area that Pamuksuz says is calling out for research right now and full of opportunities for students to gain experience in research design.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our goal is to be as up-to-the-minute as possible when it comes to teaching and sharing content with our students,” he says. “GenAI is an area still full of open questions and we saw that a research-oriented approach where faculty work directly with students as they review papers, conduct experiments, and present at academic conferences would be the best way for students to understand these technologies at a fundamental level.”\n",
      "\n",
      "**Connecting Academia to Industry**\n",
      "\n",
      "For his part, Pamuksuz has straddled research and industry throughout his career. While earning his PhD in machine learning, he collaborated with professors in finance, marketing, and healthcare information systems to understand how these abstract methodologies connect to other disciplines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can do data science and use machine learning tools on virtually anything,” he says. “That’s what really caught my eye: The research side and the applied side are in constant dialogue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having led data science teams at several Fortune 500 companies and co-founded the machine-learning company Inference Analytics, Pamuksuz also continues to do his own research, attend conferences, and publish in journals. He says it gives him an advantage when teaching in the Applied Data Science classroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll show students how particular GenAI tools are being applied today, but then I’ll also highlight how the area is a live research area that’s still open to exploration and being looked at from various angles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first round of research projects, Pamuksuz and other faculty selected healthcare as the domain area. With solid data sets, innumerable potential use cases, and a positive social factor, the domain gives students an ideal instrument to more deeply understand and operationalize the foundational concepts driving the latest GenAI transformer models.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our goal was to work with students and get them to understand these models on the most basic levels, down even to figuring out what each single neuron is doing and how they’re interacting with each other and the specific journey leading to the output. These areas are still very poorly understood today.”\n",
      "\n",
      "**PhD-Lite Experience**\n",
      "\n",
      "For their research capstone project, Andrew Alvarez, Mary Erikson, and Tegan Keigher leveraged the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate results for CT radiology reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "With up to fifty percent of radiologists’s time spent drafting reports today, transformer models that can automate the documenting process have the potential to save time and reduce the stress responsible for increasing burnout in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having started their project in early 2023—just months after the groundbreaking release of ChatGPT—the team was particularly excited to dive into an area that was so timely and full of potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s been really incredible to focus on such a central topic in the world right now and dissect the nuts and bolts taking place inside it,” says Erikson, an analytical lead at Google.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At first the idea of building our own transformer model might’ve felt a little like we were biting off more than we could chew, but through reading the key research papers, learning in class, and talking with each other and Utku, we were able to get a handle on this new area and connect it with what we’d learned already in the program.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alvarez, an engagement manager at United Airlines, says that “doing something research-based gave us an entirely new experience, one that allowed us to pick up a different sort of skillset that’s still amenable to the workplace. It was something like a PhD-lite experience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The capstone-related work has also helped me guide others taking their first steps into using transformer models,” Alvarez adds. “Automating areas that are putting a strain on our teams allows us to focus on the work that matters. That’s where I think these technologies will really shine.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The selective research-focused conference gave them the opportunity to mingle with top experts in the field and view firsthand what was taking place on the frontiers of research.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Thirty students from the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science program(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) embarked on an exciting adventure on May 20th: a visit to the Google office. This trip was a reward for their completion of the Career Course, a class designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge to navigate the job market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day started with a fun icebreaker – students introduced themselves and shared their favorite Google product. The range was impressive, from everyday tools such as Google Calendar to cutting-edge data science solutions like the recently launched large language model Gemini. Next, students got an insider’s perspective through presentations from seven Googlers, each detailing their typical workday experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highlight for many students was access to [Google Labs(https://labs.google), a digital playground for experimenting with the latest AI tools and testing hypotheses. Students explored projects such as Generative AI with Vertex AI and Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Vertex AI Gemini API.\n",
      "\n",
      "To wrap up the visit, students toured the Google office, complete with well-stocked snack rooms, an arcade for work breaks, and a unique workspace – an old CTA train car on the rooftop, equipped with Wi-Fi!\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Student perspective**\n",
      "\n",
      "The trip left a lasting impression on the students. Jean-Sebastien Gaultier, a current student in the program, said: “The invitation to Google was a great surprise! Meeting professionals in different sectors of Google Cloud gave me a great idea of the inner workings of Google. The amazing office spaces further enhanced the experience. Working in a 10-story building dedicated to collaboration is inspiring – who wouldn’t want to work at Google after seeing the office?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another student, Pamela Gonzalez Muniz, found the Google AM/ML Solutions presentation particularly captivating. “Learning that so many of today’s leading AI technologies originated at Google was fascinating.” She went on to say that gaining insights into future trends and tools was invaluable. What surprised Gonzalez Muniz the most was the well-rounded nature of Google’s employee roles. She noted that all of the presenters possessed strong technical skills, business acumen, and excellent interpersonal abilities.\n",

      "MS in Applied Data Science Students spend the day at Google\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty students from the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science program(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) embarked on an exciting adventure on May 20th: a visit to the Google office. This trip was a reward for their completion of the Career Course, a class designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge to navigate the job market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day started with a fun icebreaker – students introduced themselves and shared their favorite Google product. The range was impressive, from everyday tools such as Google Calendar to cutting-edge data science solutions like the recently launched large language model Gemini. Next, students got an insider’s perspective through presentations from seven Googlers, each detailing their typical workday experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highlight for many students was access to [Google Labs(https://labs.google), a digital playground for experimenting with the latest AI tools and testing hypotheses. Students explored projects such as Generative AI with Vertex AI and Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Vertex AI Gemini API.\n",
      "\n",
      "To wrap up the visit, students toured the Google office, complete with well-stocked snack rooms, an arcade for work breaks, and a unique workspace – an old CTA train car on the rooftop, equipped with Wi-Fi!\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Student perspective**\n",
      "\n",
      "The trip left a lasting impression on the students. Jean-Sebastien Gaultier, a current student in the program, said: “The invitation to Google was a great surprise! Meeting professionals in different sectors of Google Cloud gave me a great idea of the inner workings of Google. The amazing office spaces further enhanced the experience. Working in a 10-story building dedicated to collaboration is inspiring – who wouldn’t want to work at Google after seeing the office?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another student, Pamela Gonzalez Muniz, found the Google AM/ML Solutions presentation particularly captivating. “Learning that so many of today’s leading AI technologies originated at Google was fascinating.” She went on to say that gaining insights into future trends and tools was invaluable. What surprised Gonzalez Muniz the most was the well-rounded nature of Google’s employee roles. She noted that all of the presenters possessed strong technical skills, business acumen, and excellent interpersonal abilities.\n",

      "\n",
      "    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\n",
      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",
      "  * Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications \n",
      "\n",
      "    This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.\n",

The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class discussions, group assignments, and a final group project. The course lays special emphasis on algorithms. Hence it draws heavily from the fields of optimization, machine-learning based recommendation systems, association rules, consumer choice models, Bayesian estimation, experimentation and analysis of covariance, advanced visualization techniques for mapping brand perceptions, and analysis of social media data using advanced NLP techniques.\n",
      "  * Data Science for Healthcare \n",
      "\n",
      "    Given the breadth of the field of health analytics, this course will provide an overview of the development and rapid expansion of analytics in healthcare, major and emerging topical areas, and current issues related to research methods to improve human health. We will cover such topics as security concerns unique to the field, research design strategies, and the integration of epidemiologic and quality improvement methodologies to operationalize data for continuous improvement. Students will be introduced to the application of predictive analytics to healthcare. Students will understand factors impacting the delivery of quality and safe patient care and the application of data-driven methods to improve care at the healthcare system level, design approaches to answering a research question at the population level, become familiar with the application of data analytics to impacting care at the provider level through Clinical Decision Systems, and understand the process of a Clinical Trial.\n",

Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\n",

      "    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture.

      "  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence \n",
      "\n",
      "    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n",

Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist looking to level up your career or considering a career switch to data science, here’s what you need to know to stand out and succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trait #1: Some Prior Experience with Python or R**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with the basics. No, we don’t need you to be a coding wizard (though, if you are, that’s awesome!). But you should have dabbled a bit in Python or R. What does that mean? If someone says, “Download this library in Jupyter Notebook,” you shouldn’t be scratching your head. Instead, you should be nodding along, maybe even excited to try it out.\n",

      "# Applying to the MS in Applied Data Science Program? Here’s What We Look For\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you submit your MS in Applied Data Science application, explore some key traits we look for in our candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking about applying to the [MS in Applied Data Science(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program at the University of Chicago? We’re thrilled to have you here! Our program is designed for ambitious problem-solvers ready to make a difference in fields ranging from healthcare to finance and beyond. To help you put your best foot forward, we’re sharing a few key traits we look for in applicants. Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist looking to level up your career or considering a career switch to data science, here’s what you need to know to stand out and succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trait #1: Some Prior Experience with Python or R**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with the basics. No, we don’t need you to be a coding wizard (though, if you are, that’s awesome!). But you should have dabbled a bit in Python or R. What does that mean? If someone says, “Download this library in Jupyter Notebook,” you shouldn’t be scratching your head. Instead, you should be nodding along, maybe even excited to try it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Know your data types—strings, Booleans, integers, floats, all that jazz. And if you’ve played around with data frames or created some basic data visualizations, you’re on the right track.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this sounds foreign, don’t panic! There are great resources to help you get up to speed without breaking the bank. Daniel Truesdale, one of our own, started with the Coursera course “[Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)(https://www.coursera.org/learn/python).” He also honed his skills through [Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/) and [Datacamp(https://www.datacamp.com/) competitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, you don’t need a technical background, but some familiarity with Python or R is key.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trait #2: Collaboration is Key**\n",
      "\n",
      "Our students are movers and shakers, ready to make an impact in tech, finance, sports, media, healthcare, education, government, logistics—you name it. Transitioning from theory to real-world impact means working well with others. We look for students who are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Team Players**: You’re comfortable working alongside people from different backgrounds and perspectives.\n",
      "* **Community Builders**: You want to be part of our community, help build it, and stay connected even after graduation.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll learn a lot from our faculty, but also from your classmates. Grad school is as much about building your network as it is about hitting the books.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trait #3: Be Authentic**\n",
      "\n",
      "Just be yourself. We don’t expect you to be a master of math, statistics, and programming before you even start (otherwise, why would you need us?). Be open about where you need to grow, but also proud of what you bring to the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authenticity goes a long way. It helps us understand who you are and how you’ll fit into and contribute to our community.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you’re thinking about applying, keep these traits in mind. We can’t wait to see what you’ll bring to the University of Chicago!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trait #4: Relax and communicate effectively**\n",
      "\n",
      "Students must submit a video recording of themselves answering one question as part of their application requirements, a second video prompt is optional. Practice presenting in front of the camera and review the video before submitting. Make sure you are speaking loudly and calmly.

    "You are an expert technical editor tasked with refining Markdown content for a knowledge base. Your goal is to improve the clarity, conciseness, and consistency of the text while strictly preserving all factual information and the original Markdown structure (especially headers).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Read the entire provided Markdown text carefully.**\n",
    "2.  **Focus on the textual content under each existing header.**\n",
    "3.  **Improve Clarity and Conciseness:**\n",
    "    * Rephrase sentences or paragraphs for better readability if they are awkward, verbose, or unclear.\n",
    "    * Remove redundant words or phrases without changing the meaning.\n",
    "    * Ensure smooth transitions between ideas within a section.\n",
    "4.  **Maintain Factual Accuracy:**\n",
    "    * **Crucially, do NOT add any new information, facts, statistics, or opinions that are not explicitly present in the original text.**\n",
    "    * **Do NOT alter any existing factual information, data, numbers, dates, or specific names.**\n",
    "    * Preserve all URLs and link text in Markdown links (e.g., `[text](url)`) exactly as they are.\n",
    "    * Preserve all code blocks (```) and inline code (` `` `) exactly as they are.\n",
    "5.  **Preserve Structure:**\n",
    "    * **Do NOT change the existing Markdown header levels (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`) or the text of the headers themselves.** The current header structure is vital for subsequent processing.\n",
    "    * Do NOT add new headers or sections.\n",
    "    * Do NOT remove existing headers or sections, even if the content under them is brief.\n",
    "    * Maintain the original order of sections and paragraphs.\n",
    "6.  **Formatting:**\n",
    "    * Ensure consistent Markdown formatting for elements like lists, bolding, and italics, but only if the original intent is clear and the change improves consistency. Do not introduce new formatting styles arbitrarily.\n",
    "    * Correct any minor Markdown syntax errors if found (e.g., a list item not starting correctly).\n",
    "7.  **Output:**\n",
    "    * Provide only the refined Markdown text as your output. Do not include any commentary, preamble, or explanation.\n",

    "**Input Markdown Text:**\n",
