[### Are standardized tests required for admission?\\n\\nAs part of the online application, candidates will be required to submit a GMAT or GRE score for the joint program. International applicants may be required to submit proof of English language proficiency by submitting a TOEFL iBT or IELTS test score. The minimum TOEFL iBT score required for admission is 104; the minimum IELTS score required is 7. Proof of English proficiency may be waived under certain criteria noted by UChicago GRAD Admissions., ### What are the minimum scores required?\\n\\nThe minimum required score for the TOEFL is 102 overall. Minimum required scores in the IELTS are an overall score of seven. (Note: students are required to take the Academic Reading/Writing test within IELTS, not the General Training Reading/Writing test). TOEFL or IELTS score reports are valid for two years and scores will be considered expired if the test was taken more than two years prior to submission of the application. Photocopies of TOEFL or IELTS Score Reports will not be considered valid., ### English Language Requirement\\n\\nApplicants to the Master‚Äôs in Applied Data Science program who do not meet the English Language Proficiency criteria must submit proof of English language proficiency.\\n\\nMinimum scores for the Master‚Äôs in Applied Data Science program: TOEFL, 102 (no subscore requirement); IELTS, 7 (no subscore requirement).\\n\\nPlease review our [waiver policy here](https://grad.uchicago.edu/admissions/apply/english-language-requirements/).]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I apologize, but there are no documents available that provide information on the minimum scores required for the TOEFL and IELTS English Language Requirement for the Applied Data Science program.

[### Once I upload my unofficial transcripts to my application, do I still need to provide an official transcript?\\n\\nOne unofficial transcript from each university you attended must be uploaded within the application. An unofficial transcript for undergraduate coursework is still required for the application even if you hold an advanced degree(s). Please do not mail transcripts as part of your admission application; we only require unofficial uploads for application evaluation. If you are offered admission, one official transcript for each university you attended will be required at least one month prior to matriculation., ### Transcripts from all previous colleges and universities attended\\n\\nWhen applying to the program, only your *unofficial* transcripts are required. If you are admitted into the program, then official transcripts must be sent to the following (note a bachelor‚Äôs degree is required to apply to the program):\\n\\nPlease have your institution send your e-transcripts directly to:  \\n**applieddatascience-admissions@uchicago.edu**.\\n\\n***If*** your institution cannot send your documents electronically, please have them send your transcripts to the following mailing address.\\n\\nPlease note, if documents are being mailed, we must receive them in their original, school-sealed envelope. If your documents are not received in a school-sealed envelope, they will be considered unofficial. Additionally, if your transcript does not list degree conferral information (degree earned and date of conferral), we will also need to receive an attested copy of your degree certificate.\\n\\nThe University of Chicago  \\nAttention: MS in Applied Data Science Admissions  \\n455 N Cityfront Plaza Dr., Suite 950  \\nChicago, Illinois 60611, ### If I am admitted to the Master's in Applied Data Science program, what do I do next?\\n\\nHave official e-transcripts sent to applieddatascience-admissions@uchicago.edu.\\n\\nIf your institution cannot send your documents electronically, please have them send your transcripts to the following mailing address:\\n\\nThe University of Chicago\\nAttention: MS in Applied Data Science Admissions\\n455 N Cityfront Plaza Dr., Suite 950\\nChicago, Illinois 60611]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The University of Chicago\\nAttention: MS in Applied Data Science Admissions\\n455 N Cityfront Plaza Dr., Suite 950\\nChicago, Illinois 60611           NaN          0.000000                1.0        1.000000            0.177993\n",

Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\\n\\n  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (Elective Course)\\n\\n    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\\n\\n  * Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications (Elective Course)\\n\\n    This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed.

We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô.\\n\\n  * Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing (Elective Course)\\n\\n    This course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI.

It covers three pillars in MLOps: software engineering such as software architecture, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and data versioning; model engineering such as AutoML and A/B experimentation; and deployment engineering such as docker containers and model monitoring. The course focuses on best practices in the industry that are critical to enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects. Having completed this course, a student understands the machine learning lifecycle and what it takes to go from ideation to operationalization in an enterprise environment. Furthermore, students get exposure to state-of-the-art MLOps platforms such as allegro, xpresso, Dataiku, LityxIQ, DataRobot, AWS Sagemaker, and technologies such as gitHub, Jenkins, slack, docker, and kubernetes.\\n\\n  * Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing (Elective Course)\\n\\n    Extracting actionable insights from unstructured text and designing cognitive applications have become significant areas of application for analytics. Students in this course will learn foundations of natural language processing, including: concept extraction; text summarization and topic modeling; part of speech tagging; named entity recognition; semantic roles and sentiment analysis. For advanced NLP applications, we will focus on feature extraction from unstructured text, including word and paragraph embedding and representing words and paragraphs as vectors. For cognitive analytics section of the course, students will practice designing question answering systems with intent classification, semantic knowledge extraction and reasoning under uncertainty. Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding.\\n\\n  * Real Time Intelligent Systems (Elective Course)\\n\\n    Developing end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students. The course focuses on python and is tailored for students with basic programming knowledge in python. The course is partially project based. During the first three sessions, we will review basic python concepts and then learn more advanced python and the ways to use python to handle large data flows. The later sessions are project based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems.\\n\\n  * Reinforcement Learning (Elective Course)\\n\\n    This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‚Äòcurse of dimensionality‚Äô which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\\n\\n  * Supply Chain Optimization (Elective Course)\\n\\n    ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order ‚Äúcustom‚Äù product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain. Students will also learn how to optimize the performance of the Supply Chain from the lens of multiple related disciplines including: Sales Forecasting, Warehousing/Inventory Management, Promotion, Pricing, Logistics Network Optimization, Freight Cost Management, Manufacturing, Retail POS Information, Ecommerce, Consumer Data, and Product Design/Packaging. After completing this course, you will be prepared to work in any of the numerous specialty areas possible in the world of Supply Chain Management., ## By and For Data Science Innovators\\n\\nYou will earn UChicago‚Äôs Master‚Äôs in Applied Data Science by successfully completing 12 courses (6 core, 4 elective, 2 Capstone) and our tailored Career Seminar*.\\n\\nTo keep up with the rapidly evolving field and job market, you will be challenged by our rigorous curriculum that is designed by and for data science innovators and leaders.

[### Once I upload my unofficial transcripts to my application, do I still need to provide an official transcript?\\n\\nOne unofficial transcript from each university you attended must be uploaded within the application. An unofficial transcript for undergraduate coursework is still required for the application even if you hold an advanced degree(s). Please do not mail transcripts as part of your admission application; we only require unofficial uploads for application evaluation. If you are offered admission, one official transcript for each university you attended will be required at least one month prior to matriculation., ### Transcripts from all previous colleges and universities attended\\n\\nWhen applying to the program, only your *unofficial* transcripts are required. If you are admitted into the program, then official transcripts must be sent to the following (note a bachelor‚Äôs degree is required to apply to the program):\\n\\nPlease have your institution send your e-transcripts directly to:  \\n**applieddatascience-admissions@uchicago.edu**.\\n\\n***If*** your institution cannot send your documents electronically, please have them send your transcripts to the following mailing address.\\n\\nPlease note, if documents are being mailed, we must receive them in their original, school-sealed envelope.
