# PhD in Data Science

Run by the Committee on Data Science, the PhD curriculum combines training in mathematical foundations of data science, responsible data use and communication, and advanced computational methods.

Students conduct research on cutting edge problems alongside preeminent faculty at UChicago and explore the emerging field of Data Science. As an emerging discipline, Data Science addresses foundational problems across the entire data life cycle. Tackling issues of inequity, climate change, and sustainability will require cutting edge research in artificial intelligence and data usage combined with innovative educational programs to train students in the concepts of information systems. Students of Data Science will not only immerse themselves in a rapidly evolving field; they will help redefine it altogether.

#### Research Excellence:

As a PhD student in Data Science, you will learn from faculty who have developed research programs that span a wide variety of data science and AI topics, from theory to applications, with a focus on making a societal impact.
