**Project Title:** Evolution of Annoyingness

**Project Description:**We analyzed the time and the sentiment (as a contributing factor to the emotion of irritation) of the tweets from a data pipeline we had created using the Academic Twitter API. Leveraging Machine Learning algorithms, we found that the day of the month can be almost as predictive as the tweet content for predicting/classifying the sentiment.

**Mentor:**[Ravi Madduri](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ravi-k-madduri)

**Project Title:**Machine Learning Mobile Applications for Health Promotion

**Project Description:**This summer, alongside fellow cohort member Daniel Chechelnitsky, she worked with Dr. Ravi Madduri to create a mobile health app implementing machine learning models of disease prediction. Using Flutter, an open-source UI software development kit launched by Google, she designed and implemented the front-end and back-end components of the application, working with SQL databases and TensorFlowLite machine learning models among other things. The code for the final product can be found [here](https://github.com/chechelnitskd/prostate_predict).

**Project Title:**Analysis of Police Broadcast Audio at Scale

**Project Description:**With policing coming under greater scrutiny in recent years, researchers have begun to more thoroughly study the effects of contact between police and minority communities. Despite data archives of hundreds of thousands of recorded Broadcast Police Communications (BPC) being openly available to the public, a closer look at a large-scale analysis of the language of policing has remained largely unexplored. While this research is critical in understanding a “pre-reflective” notion of policing, the large quantity of data presents numerous challenges in its organization and analysis.

We conducted preliminary work toward enabling Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) in an analysis of the Chicago Police Department’s (CPD) BPC by demonstrating the pipelined creation of a datastore to enable a multimodal analysis of composed raw audio files.

**Project Title:**Measuring Race and Gender Representation in Children’s Books Using Sentiment Analysis

**Project Description:**We measured race and gender representation in award-winning children’s books using sentiment analysis. Our goal was to find the sentiment towards characters to understand how different racial groups or genders are represented in these books. Sharing our findings with teachers, librarians, and parents will help us move towards a more equitable society.

**Project Title:**Social Impact Track – Schmidt Ocean Institute, ROV Dive Processing

**Project Description:**In collaboration with the Schmidt Ocean Institute, our team was tasked with contributing to the foundation of an open source oceanographic video processing pipeline. Our primary goal was to implement an unsupervised video summarization model which will produce highlight reels of underwater ROV dive videos. Our secondary goal was to produce a pipeline which will tag dive video frames with informative labels using a variety of pixel-based algorithms and models.

**Project Title:**Exploring Machine Learning Applications in Mobile Health Development

**Project Description:**Mobile apps have real potential in helping individuals understand their risks for various diseases and help make better choices to lower their risks. Using Flutter, we developed a navigable and scalable mobile app environment, decided on UI/UX design of the app, implemented a static risk calculator (prostate cancer) and a image classification ML model (skin cancer). We also tried building and training our own regression models, but we were not able to deploy them in the Flutter framework.

**Project Title:**Exploring POV Effect for Stealthy Adversarial Patch Generation

**Project Description:**Facial recognition is becoming more popular nowadays, but how can we protect our privacy and prevent cameras from using images to recognize us? Using eyeware that projects light onto the face, flashing the light in a distinct pattern creates an effect called the “pov” effect, essentially making it so when cameras take an image of your face, the image will be distorted and recognition of the individual will fail.

**Project Title:**Social Impact Track – Schmidt Ocean Institute, ROV Dive Processing

**Project Description:**The Schmidt Ocean Institute uses a remote operated robot to collect video footage of the ocean but needed ways to efficiently parse through this video. Our team developed deep learning unsupervised models to create highlight reels of the robot dives. We also used various machine learning techniques to create tags for notable aspects of the videos.

**Project Title:**Emotionally Intelligent Robots

**Project Description:**Developing a machine learning model to predict psychological safety and inclusion for participants of a group conversation from audio-visual data. This could be a jumping off point for social robots, to behave according to group-dynamics, and perhaps even create ways to improve those dynamics.

**Project Title:**Social Impact Track – Human Rights Media Analysis

**Project Description:**Working with the UN Human Rights Office (UN OHCHR), my team built a feature extraction and NLP classification pipeline that categorised the credibility level of news articles on human rights incidents. In the pipeline, we used sci-kits learn, hugginface, spaCy, and gensim. The resulting pipeline will streamline the process of human rights analysis for UN analysts.

**Project Title:**Exa.TrkX

**Project Description:**I worked on the Exa.TrkX project which presents a graph neural network (GNN) technique for low-level reconstruction of neutrino interactions in a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC). Graphs describing particle interactions are formed by treating each detector hit as a node, with vertices describing the relationships between hits. The model itself is a multihead attention message passing network which performs graph convolutions in order to label each node with a particle type.

**Project Title:**Deep Diagnostics of Convolutional Neural Networks

**Project Description:**My project focused on how to efficiently access fundamental diagnostics to train and optimize CNN’s. I investigated multiple diagnostics programs to determine how they function to help evaluate model performance. However, Testing these diagnostic tools supported my initial hypothesis that these programs didn’t offer easy access to the fundamental diagnostics of a model I was looking for. So I built a diagnostic package that cuts out extraneous features, and with those, the need for external resources or a deep knowledge of coding to provide new and inexperienced users with the fundamental diagnostics they need.

**Project Title:**AWS Spot Market Trends from 2018 and 2021

**Project Description:** In late 2017, Amazon changed the spot market algorithm with the aim of decreasing price variability, increasing spot instance durability, and regularizing the market (Baughman et al, 2019). These changes have made it impossible to rely on the previous strategy of using supply and demand to make decisions. Our research looks at 2021 spot market prices and comparing them to 2018 and compare findings to results found in Deconstructing the 2017 Changes to AWS Spot Market.

**Project Title:**Exa.TrkX: Improving Graph Neural Network Performance for Classifying Neutrino Interactions in MicroBooNE Data

**Project Description:**The Exa.TrkX project presents a graph neural network (GNN) technique for low-level reconstruction of neutrino interactions in a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC). We discovered that the GNN model trained on DUNE simulation data performs quite poorly on the data from another neutrino detection experiment (MicroBooNE). After my colleague Kaushal modified the model architecture that allowed to detach the physical meaning from neutrino interaction graph edges, I explored new edge-forming techniques (such as Delaunay triangulation, KNN-graph, and radius graph) and retrained the model on MicroBooNE data, which resulted in 80% classification accuracy for physically meaningful interactions.

**Project Title:**Social Impact Track – PalmWatch

**Project Description:**Built a model in Jupyter Lab that compares correlations between columns of risk scores,  
created an overlaid histogram of risk scores per mill type, found the risk scores for mills from 2001-2019 using a function, found the year each mill was certified and used this certification column and the risk score columns to build a random forest. The Random Forest predicts for every single year whether or not mills are certified. I also built a logistic regression to predicts what type of certification they have, if they are not certified or certified.

**Project Title:**Social Impact Track – Human Rights Media Analysis

**Project Description:**The ongoing pandemic disrupted the UN’s Office of Human Rights’ ability to conduct field monitoring, leading them to identify human rights incidents from news media. We implemented a Human Rights Media Analysis software tool which automates much of the early stages of data processing for the UNOHCHR. Our tool extracts features from a human rights report/news article and assigns a credibility score (low, medium or high) to the article.
