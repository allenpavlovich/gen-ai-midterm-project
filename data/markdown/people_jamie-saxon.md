# Jamie Saxon

Senior Software Engineer, Mapbox

DSI Postdoctoral Scholar 2020-2022

Jamie Saxon joined DSI as a postdoctoral scholar in summer 2020, and was previously a postdoctoral fellow with the [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and the [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/) of the University of Chicago.

He uses large data sources to measure the [availability](https://saxon.harris.uchicago.edu/accessiblity) and [use](https://saxon.harris.uchicago.edu/parks/) of civic and social resources in American cities. He is particularly interested in [mobility](https://saxon.harris.uchicago.edu/neighborhoods) among neighborhoods and the consequences of this mobility. He has also studied how [gerrymandering](https://saxon.harris.uchicago.edu/gerrymandering) affects representation, and developed powerful automated districting [software](https://github.com/JamesSaxon/c4).

He is committed to developing [resources](http://access.readthedocs.io/) for computational social science research, and has taught [programming](https://harris-ippp.github.io/fall-2017) and [statistics](https://saxon.harris.uchicago.edu/site/stat_syllabus.pdf) for masters’ students in public policy.

He was trained as a particle physicist and was previously an Enrico Fermi Fellow on the ATLAS Experiment on CERN’s Large Hadron Collider at the [Enrico Fermi Institute](https://efi.uchicago.edu/). He worked for many years on electronics and firmware for measuring and reconstructing particle trajectories. As a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, he made [noteworthy](https://po.usatlas.bnl.gov/programoffice/usatlas_awards) [contributions](https://atlas.cern/discover/collaboration/awards) to the discovery and first measurements of the Higgs Boson in the two-photon channel.
