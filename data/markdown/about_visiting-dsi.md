About

# Visiting DSI

The Data Science Institute is based on the University of Chicago campus in Hyde Park, housed across four buildings.

DSI leadership and administrative staff sit in the [John Crerar Library Building](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/about/our-new-building/), co-located with the [UChicago Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/). The general mailing address for the Data Science Institute is this location:

*John Crerar Library Building*  
*5730 S. Ellis Ave*  
*Chicago, IL 60637*

DSI faculty and research staff are located in [Searle Chemistry Laboratory](https://facilities.uchicago.edu/construction/searle/), 5735 S. Ellis Ave. Educational Programs sit in [Ryerson Laboratory](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/collex/exhibits/ryerson-physical-laboratory-and-eckhart-hall/ryerson-physical-laboratory/), 1100 E 58th St, and the [NBC Tower](https://professional.uchicago.edu/visit), 455 N Cityfront Plaza Dr.

For short visits, metered street parking is often available on Ellis Avenue. For longer visits, or during peak hours, we recommend parking in University garages at 55th Street & Ellis or 57th Street & Cottage Grove. A map of all UChicago parking options is available [here](https://d3qi0qp55mx5f5.cloudfront.net/safety-security/uploads/files/2019_Parking_map_11.27.19.pdf?mtime=1575909818).

If you are taking a rideshare or taxi to our buildings, it is often best to choose the University of Chicago bookstore (970 E. 58th Street) as your destination, then walk a short distance to the DSI offices. A campus map is available [here](https://maps.uchicago.edu/).

[University shuttle buses](https://safety-security.uchicago.edu/services/university_shuttles/) and [CTA routes #171 and #172](https://safety-security.uchicago.edu/transportation/#:~:text=and%2053rd%20Streets.-,Use%20CTA%20routes%20%232%2C%20%236%2C%20%2315%2C,between%20campus%20and%20the%20stop.&text=Runs%20daily%20between%20the%20South%20Bend%20Airport%20and%20Millennium%20Station.&text=To%20access%20campus%2C%20use%20the%2057th%20Street%20Metra%20station.) also stop in front of the bookstore or Levi Hall on the east side of Ellis Ave. For information on taking CTA or Metra train lines to the University of Chicago campus, see [here](https://safety-security.uchicago.edu/transportation/#:~:text=and%2053rd%20Streets.-,Use%20CTA%20routes%20%232%2C%20%236%2C%20%2315%2C,between%20campus%20and%20the%20stop.&text=Runs%20daily%20between%20the%20South%20Bend%20Airport%20and%20Millennium%20Station.&text=To%20access%20campus%2C%20use%20the%2057th%20Street%20Metra%20station.).
