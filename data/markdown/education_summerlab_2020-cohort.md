This summer, he worked with [Prof. Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/) and [Galen Harrison](https://galenharrison.com/) in the [SUPERGroup Lab](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/) on a project developing a Jupyter plugin called Retrograde that can be used by data scientists to create fairer machine learning (ML) models. Rather than testing the model for fairness after the model is created, Retrograde intervenes during the ML building process helping data scientists to think about and document fairness in relation to the data they are working with. His work this summer consisted of creating a study design to help develop Retrograde with the hopes of collecting and analyzing qualitative data from interviews of different ML stakeholders.

**Project:**Latent Attention & Training ML Algorithms

**Mentors:** [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/), [SUPERGroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning // Security & Privacy

**Project Description:**Jamar Sullivan is an incoming freshman at the University of Chicago studying computer science and astrophysics, and recent high school graduate from Gwendolyn Brooks College Prep. This summer, he continued work with [Prof. Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/) in the [SUPERGroup Lab](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/) to explore the difference in machine learning models’ performance when using human-collected vs. machine-learned attention. The project created a user interface that requires users to select words that they believe indicate the sentiment of a movie review, and then created a model that would learn the indicative words in a movie review dataset. It’s understood that attention can lead to greater performance in machine learning models, but collecting human information means that it is possible to collect more data from the same sized dataset, and get high accuracy with a smaller model.
