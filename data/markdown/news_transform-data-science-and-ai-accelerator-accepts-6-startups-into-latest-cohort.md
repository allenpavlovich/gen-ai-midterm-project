# Transform Data Science and AI Accelerator Accepts 6 Startups into Latest Cohort

!

**The [University of Chicago’s Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/) and [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/) today announced the six early-stage companies accepted into the fourth cohort of the [Transform](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/programs-events/transform/)accelerator for data science and AI startups.**

“This was one of the most competitive and difficult selection processes to date, with 30% more applications compared to last year,” said Shyama Majumdar, director of science accelerators and investments at the Polsky Center. “We are seeing some really hot areas like space tech and an increase in digital health technologies. One of the startups has already started getting VC interest from our reviewer panel – we will see some great things from this cohort.”

The six startups will receive approximately $325,000 in total investment, including an optional $25,000 in funding, credits for Google for Startups, workspace in Harper Court on Chicago’s South Side, and access to industry mentors, technical advisors, and student talent from the University of Chicago’s [Department of Computer Science](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/), [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/) (DSI), and [Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/).

“At the Data Science Institute, we are excited to help this next cohort push the boundaries of what’s next in cutting-edge AI and data science,” said David Uminsky, executive director of the DSI. “We are committed to supporting their journey and are thrilled by the continued success of Transform.”

A participant in Cohort 3, [Healee](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/2024/03/19/healee-applying-ai-to-improve-the-consumer-experience-in-healthcare/) described the program as “extremely insightful and transformative” – and was able to close its seed round within two weeks of completing the program. “It helped to significantly adjust our positioning and strategy,” they said.

The first two cohorts of Transform startups to date have raised more than $12 million.

“As investments and advancements in this space continue to accelerate exponentially, the Data Science Institute, with the mission of addressing important scientific and societal questions, is uniquely positioned to support entrepreneurs looking to answer these same questions,” said Dan Nicolae, DSI faculty co-director.

Transform is partly supported by corporate partners [McAndrews, Held & Malloy, Ltd](https://www.mcandrews-ip.com/) and venture partner, [True Blue Partners](https://truebluepartners.com/), a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm investing in early-stage AI companies, founded by Chicago Booth alum Sunil Grover, MBA ‘99.

“We are thrilled to support the Polsky Center’s Transform accelerator as it welcomes its newest cohort of data science and AI startups. At True Blue Partners, we recognize the transformative potential of combining entrepreneurial hustle with the deep tech infrastructure and resources available at the University of Chicago,” said Sunil Grover, managing director and founder, True Blue Partners. “By providing these innovative startups with access to these resources, mentorship, and funding, Transform is paving the way for groundbreaking advancements that will shape the future of artificial intelligence.”
