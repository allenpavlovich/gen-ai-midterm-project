# CDAC Discovery Grant Proposer’s Day

Join us for a Proposer's Day on October 15th for the Autumn 2019 cycle of the Discovery Grant Seed Fund. Presenters will receive immediate feedback on your idea and find collaborators before applying.

October 15, 2019 3:30 PM – 5:00 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 390

CDAC Discovery Grants support multidisciplinary research projects that have the potential for high-impact research breakthroughs or new technological innovations. See funded examples from our previous Discovery Grant cycle [here](/news/cdac-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-data-science-discovery-projects/).

The goal of this event is to provide potential Collaborative Research Project applicants to the Autumn 2019 cycle with preliminary, informal feedback on their proposals ideas from members of the CDAC steering committee. Feedback will be provided directly after each 3-minute presentation, and a written summary of feedback will be sent to presenters after the event. After the presentations, all attendees will be free to converse and network with one another for the rest of the event.

Attend this event to:

* Learn more about the [CDAC Discovery Grants](/engage/research-funding/).
* Gain early feedback on your proposal idea.
* Meet potential collaborators and student researchers, as well as other people within the data science community.

We encourage applicants with PI status to register to give a 3-minute presentation focused on your idea. **RSVPs for all attendees — presenters and general audience members — are due** **by Friday October 11th**. A confirmation of the proposal presentations will be sent to all presenters by Monday, October 14th. Presenters are encouraged but not required to use the slide template **[here](https://bit.ly/2kXh6D5)**.

For more information about the Discovery Grants, review cycle deadlines and criteria, and access to the RFP, please see the [call for proposals announcement](/news/cdac-opens-autumn-2019-discovery-grant-call-for-proposals/). The proposer’s day event is open to all faculty, students and staff from UChicago and TTIC.
