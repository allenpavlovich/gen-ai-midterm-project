# Outlier Research & Evaluation at DSI publishes a new study of high school data science

Findings are in a newly launched website

Researchers [Jeanne Century](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/jeanne-century/) and [Joanna Schiffman](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/joanna-schiffman/) carried out a year-long study of the high school data science first-year course pilot in the state of Utah. The first part of the study yielded detailed descriptions of four leading high school data science curricula – Bootstrap, CourseKata, IDS, and youcubed. The second part of the study entailed collaborating with the Utah Department of Education to examine the implementation of three of these curricula, teachers’ perceptions of supports and barriers to implementation, and teacher and student experiences in the course.

They have published a [website](https://hsdatasciencestudy.datascience.uchicago.edu/), which shares their findings, including a [summary](https://hsdatasciencestudy.datascience.uchicago.edu/at-a-glance/) of the four curricula, [deeper dives](https://hsdatasciencestudy.datascience.uchicago.edu/curriculum-overviews/) into each curriculum, an overview of the [study](https://hsdatasciencestudy.datascience.uchicago.edu/pilot/) and the [Utah pilot](https://hsdatasciencestudy.datascience.uchicago.edu/pilot/utah/), and experiences from the [teachers](https://hsdatasciencestudy.datascience.uchicago.edu/teacher-voices/) and [students](https://hsdatasciencestudy.datascience.uchicago.edu/student-voices/).

*This work was funded by the Valhalla Foundation.*
