# DeBIT (Development Bank Investment Tracker)

The Development Bank Investment Tracker (DeBIT) is designed to help you research projects financed by development finance institutions with independent accountability mechanisms

!

DeBIT, created by the University of Chicago Data Science Institute, [Inclusive Development International](https://www.inclusivedevelopment.net/) and the Schmidt Family Foundation’s [11th Hour Project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/11th-hour-project/), is a searchable online database, designed to bring transparency and accountability to  financing behind major development projects. DeBIT is a tool that provides quick access to key information on thousands of projects financed around the world, as well as data on community complaints against these projects. The tool is designed to provide greater transparency to the opaque world of development finance.

The core users of DeBIT are community advocates holding development finance institutions accountable for displacement or pollution, journalists covering development and environmental issues, and watchdog organizations monitoring projects for corruption. DeBIT is open source, allowing researchers worldwide to add to and help create the most comprehensive trove of records about private bank-funded development.
