# Yuxin Chen

Assistant Professor, Computer Science; Member: Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics (CCAM)

Yuxin Chen is an assistant professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/). Previously, he was a postdoctoral scholar in [Computing and Mathematical Sciences](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/), hosted by Prof. [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). He received my Ph.D. degree in [Computer Science](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/) from [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), under the supervision of Prof. [Andreas Krause](http://las.ethz.ch/krausea.html). He is a recipient of the [PIMCO Postdoctoral Fellowship](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/honors) in [Computing and Mathematical Sciences](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/honors), a [Swiss National Science Foundation Early Postdoc.Mobility](http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/careers/early-postdoc-mobility/Pages/default.aspx) fellowship, and a [Google European Doctoral Fellowship](http://googleresearch.blogspot.ie/2014/06/2014-google-phd-fellowships-supporting.html) in Interactive Machine Learning.

His research interest lies broadly in probabilistic reasoning and machine learning. He is currently working on developing interactive machine learning systems that involve active learning, sequential decision making, interpretable models and machine teaching.
