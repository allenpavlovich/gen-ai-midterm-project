Since joining Fermilab in 2016, my scientific work has focused on the search of new physics in neutrino oscillation experiments.

As a member of the MicroBooNE Collaboration (since 2016), I am mainly interested in searching for sterile neutrinos, as well as in the development of techniques for the reconstruction and analysis of Liquid Argon Time Project Chambers data. I also joined the DUNE Collaboration, where my main interest is CP violation in the neutrino sector.

Previously I worked for about a decade on the CMS experiments, with major contributions to the Higgs boson discovery, SUSY searches and Standard Model measurements.

I served as CMS Track Reconstruction convener in 2013-2014.

My research examines the different ways in which goals, desires and needs affect how people perceive and respond to our environment. My work draws from the traditions of cognitive neuroscience, social psychology and affective science. I use a broad range of methodological tools, including behavioral experiments, computational modeling, fMRI, pupillometry, naturalistic paradigms and network analyses. By combining different tools and perspectives, I seek to characterize motivational influences on human cognition at the psychological, computational and neural levels. One ultimate goal of this work is to identify behavioral and neural targets of intervention to improve socio-cognitive functioning.

I direct the [Motivation and Cognition Neuroscience Laboratory](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). I founded and direct 3DL (*threedle!*), a group of enthusiastic researchers passionate about 3D, machine learning, and visual computing. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2021 from Tel Aviv University under the supervision of [Daniel Cohen-Or](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/) and [Raja Giryes](http://web.eng.tau.ac.il/~raja).

My research is focused on building artificial intelligence for 3D data, spanning the fields of computer graphics, machine learning, and computer vision. Deep learning, the most popular form of artificial intelligence, has unlocked remarkable success on structured data (such as text, images, and video), and I am interested in harnessing the potential of these techniques to enable effective operation on unstructured 3D geometric data.

We have developed a [convolutional neural network designed specifically for meshes](https://ranahanocka.github.io/MeshCNN/), and also explored how to learn from the internal data within a single shape (for [surface reconstruction](https://ranahanocka.github.io/point2mesh/), [geometric texture synthesis](https://ranahanocka.github.io/geometric-textures/), and [point cloud consolidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06471)) – and I am interested in broader applications related to these areas. Additional research directions that I am aiming to explore include: intertwining human and machine-based creativity to advance our capabilities in 3D shape modeling and animation; learning with less supervision, for example to extract patterns and relationships from large shape collections; and making 3D neural networks more “interpretable/explainable”.

I am Assistant Instructional Professor of GIScience at the [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/), [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). My research is situated at the intersection of **data**, **computation**, and **human values**, from which I aim to critically engage with geospatial computing both practically and theoretically. My research aims to answer the question: How can we develop computational methods, which are increasingly complex, to embody social responsibility, preserve privacy, and be used to understand and mitigate inequalities and injustices? My work has been focused on issues such as:

* **Fairness in spatial computing**: Integrating fairness, equitability, and other social justice principles into spatial optimization and machine learning to address the needs of individuals and communities with varying levels of vulnerability.
* **Digital privacy**: Developing methods to protect individual privacy while providing useful geospatial data.
* **Computing for social good**: Exploring how new geospatial computing methods can help understand and reduce inequalities and improve quality of life.

**Education**

* Ph.D. in Geography, The Ohio State University, 2023
* M.A. in Geography, The Ohio State University, 2022
* B.S. in Geographic Information Science, Wuhan University, 2019

Pedro Lopes is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where he leads the Human Computer Integration lab. Lopes’ research group focuses understanding how to integrate computer interfaces with the human body—creating the interface paradigm that supersedes wearable computing. They created wearable muscle stimulation devices that enable, for example, to: a user to manipulate a tool they never seen before, accelerate our reaction time, read and write information without using a screen, and transform someone’s arm into a plotter so they can solve complex problems with pen and paper. Their work is published at top-tier conferences (ACM CHI, ACM UIST, Cerebral Cortex). Pedro and his students have received one Best Paper award, three Best Talk Awards and two Best Paper nominations. Their work also captured the interest of media, such as MIT Technology Review, NBC, Discovery Channel, NewScientist, Wired and has been shown at Ars Electronica and World Economic Forum.

Monica Rosenberg joined the faculty of The University of Chicago in 2019. She is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and member of the Committees on Computational Neuroscience and Neurobiology and the Institute for Mind and Biology. Her research explores how we pay attention and how insights from attention research can help improve focus. Dr. Rosenberg completed her PhD and postdoctoral work in the Department of Psychology at Yale University after earning her undergraduate degree in cognitive neuroscience at Brown University.

A primary focus of Dr. Rosenberg’s work has been what we can learn about a person from their unique patterns of brain activity and what this can tell us about the nature of the brain and mind. In particular, she builds models that predict attention and cognition from functional neuroimaging data. This work has revealed, for example, that data collected while a person is simply resting in an MRI scanner (and not completing any task at all) can be used to predict aspects of their behavior, including how well they pay attention and remember information. Dr. Rosenberg’s work also uses behavioral, neuroimaging, and machine learning techniques to investigate how attention fluctuates over time, changes across development, and interacts with the rest of the mind.

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Yale University in 2020. My current research explores social dynamics in human-robot interactions, where a robot’s social behaviors lead to positive outcomes for people (e.g., improved team dynamics and performance in a human-robot team, educational learning outcomes for children). During my PhD, I focused on developing robots that improve the performance of human-robot teams by shaping team dynamics to promote inclusion, trust, and cohesion.
