# Kristina Herman

Postdoctoral Scholar, Data Science Institute and Chemistry Department

Kristina joined the DSI as an AI+Science postdoctoral scholar in September 2024. She completed her PhD in Chemistry with a Data Science concentration at the University of Washington. Her graduate research (PI: Sotiris Xantheas) focused on the utility of the many-body expansion in understanding the nature of noncovalent interactions, developing accurate many-body potentials, and accelerating benchmark lattice energy calculations. At the University of Chicago (PI: Greg Voth), she will leverage machine learning to develop multi-scale models to study important biochemical reactions and processes in proteins.
