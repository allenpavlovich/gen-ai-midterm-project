# Incoming UChicago Data Science and Computer Science Associate Professor raises additional $106 million in new funding round for company, Together AI

Together AI, an artificial intelligence company using open-source research, is now valued at $1.25 billion

Before joining the University of Chicago later this year, Ce Zhang is spending his time as the CTO of Together AI, building a decentralized cloud for artificial intelligence. Zhang co-founded the company in 2022, along with fellow founders Vipul Ved Prakash, Chris Re, and Percy Liang.

According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/together-ai-valued-125-bln-salesforce-led-funding-round-2024-03-13/):

Led by Salesforce Ventures, the funding valued Together AI at $1.25 billion. Other investors in the round included Coatue Management and existing investors such as Lux Capital and Emergence Capital.

Zhang’s academic research looks at the fundamental tension between data, model, computation and infrastructure, with the final goal of democratizing machine learning and artificial intelligence. His current work focuses on building next-​generation machine learning platforms and systems that are data-​centric, human-​centric, and declaratively scalable.
