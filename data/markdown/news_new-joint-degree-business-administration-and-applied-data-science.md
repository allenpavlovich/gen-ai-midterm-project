# New Joint Degree: Business Administration and Applied Data Science

Students can better prepare themselves for a career in a data and A.I.-driven world with new joint MBA and MS-ADS degree program

Chicago Booth and the Masters in Applied Data Science Program are excited to announce a new joint-degree option for ambitious students looking to supplement their MBA studies with a cutting-edge education in data science. Students can now earn a Master’s of Business Administration (MBA) jointly with a Master’s in Applied Data Science (MS-ADS).

[This joint degree offering](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/joint-degree/mba-ms-applied-data-science) allows students to benefit not only from Booth’s transformative MBA curriculum and its deep career and student support teams, but also from the leading expertise and robust resources within the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science Program](https://landingapplieddata.psd.uchicago.edu/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=FY24_MS_Applied_Data_Science_Chicago_MDLY&utm_content=MSADS_brand&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=branded&utm_term=master%20of%20science%20in%20analytics%20university%20of%20chicago&gclid=CjwKCAiAjrarBhAWEiwA2qWdCFQl2tcCYKepMYkE3XixbDLiVdjfat910KfDPzAS8vgjrujLiqilzhoCwlcQAvD_BwE " - This Link Opens in New Window"), [the Physical Sciences Division](https://mspsd.uchicago.edu/ " - This Link Opens in New Window"), and [the Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/ " - This Link Opens in New Window"), which is focused on data science innovation, research, and education.

With this new joint degree program, students will combine a world-class management education and rigorous data science coursework. MBA/MS-ADS graduates will be prepared to excel in a wide variety of careers in business and data science, in roles such as chief data science officer, principal data scientist, product business and strategy lead, head of data engineering, A.I. strategist, vice president or director of product, product marketing manager, senior management consultant, vice president of operations, and many more.

Students will be required to take 14 classes toward their MBA degree and nine courses towards their MS degree. They will also complete [LEAD](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/academics/leadership-development)—an experiential MBA leadership development course—and the Qualified Work Experience requirement the same as any other Full-Time MBA student at Booth.

The dual-degree program is maximally flexible, allowing students to achieve the joint degree without sacrificing academic rigor or their student experience. Students will get rigorous training in data science as it relates to business applications, in the same timeframe as the standard [Full-Time MBA Program](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/full-time), all while having flexibility to tailor their curriculum to their own priorities and interests. The courses in Applied Data Science will be delivered online with classes generally being offered in the late afternoons or evenings. This allows students to schedule with ease.

“The joint Booth MBA and PSD Master’s in Applied Data Science equips aspiring leaders with the strategic business acumen of Booth—coupled with a technical mastery of data science and A.I.—to offer an unparalleled competitive advantage,” says [Greg Green](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/ " - This Link Opens in New Window"), professor and program director of the MS in Applied Data Science.
