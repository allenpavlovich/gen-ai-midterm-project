# Preceptors in Data Science

A partnership between the University of Chicago and City Colleges of Chicago to train the next generation of data science educators.

The UChicago – City Colleges of Chicago Data Science Preceptorship Program places recent Ph.D. graduates in teaching roles at both UChicago and the City Colleges and provides them with faculty mentoring and training in creating effective and inclusive learning environments. The program is part of [a broader partnership](https://civicengagement.uchicago.edu/news/university-of-chicago-city-colleges-of-chicago-join-forces-to-increase-diversity-in-science-careers) between UChicago and CCC to strengthen STEM educational and career opportunities and create a more diverse field of professionals entering the sciences. In 2024, Chicago State University joined the Preceptorship Program as part of an overall [partnership](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/the-university-of-chicago-chicago-state-university-formalize-partnership-meant-to-grow-collaborations-build-inclusive-pathways-to-emerging-scientific-fields/) with UChicago.  In addition to broadening the pipeline for STEM education locally in Chicago, the partnership hopes that this preceptorship program will serve as an adaptable and scalable model for efforts to improve diversity in data, computing and other fields.

We are currently accepting applications for preceptors to start on August 1, 2025. [Learn more and apply](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/about/jobs/#postdoc-opportunities).

Satadisha is a Preceptor focusing on data science education at the Data Science Institute of the University of Chicago, where she is working jointly with the City College of Chicago. She graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Binghamton, under the supervision of Prof. Weiyi Meng. 

Her research lies in the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval and Machine Learning. Her doctoral dissertation focussed on the problem of scalable Named Entity Recognition for Microblog Streams. To this end, her work involves applying and building state-of-the-art Deep Learning pipelines that yield more effective results for NLP tasks on microblog messages. 

She also briefly worked as a Machine Learning Engineer for the Content Growth and Moderation Team at Quora. 

In addition to her research, she had assisted the Department of Computer Science at SUNY Binghamton in teaching several graduate and undergraduate level courses. She is excited to continue her academic career and teaching journey in her role as a Preceptor. Outside her academic work, she spends time studying history, writing fiction and passionately supporting Liverpool Football Club. But mostly, she yearns for Kolkata!
