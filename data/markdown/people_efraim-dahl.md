# Efraim Dahl

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Mentor:**Sarah Sebo

**Project Title:**Emotionally Intelligent Robots

**Project Description:**Developing a machine learning model to predict psychological safety and inclusion for participants of a group conversation from audio-visual data. This could be a jumping off point for social robots, to behave according to group-dynamics, and perhaps even create ways to improve those dynamics.
