Program

# Summer 2023

The Data Science for Social Impact (DSSI) Summer Experience program launched with 24 students from 8 partner institutions.

!

The 2023 Summer Experience included 24 students from partner colleges and universities from across the U.S. and focused on spatial data science as its research theme. Professors and preceptors from the University of Chicago assisted the students in their research, as did professors from our partner institutions in the DSSI Network: North Carolina State University, Morehouse College, Howard University, City Colleges of Chicago, Fresno State, the University of Texas at San Antonio, and the University of Illinois Chicago.

Each project highlighted the need for data science training as an accessible resource for communities facing complicated problems. “During the summer, students applied a variety of data science techniques to address important issues in their communities. Many were also exposed to potential academic paths and careers that they were unaware of prior to participating in the CAN Social Impact Summer Experience,” said Mario Bañuelos, Associate Professor of Mathematics and CAN DSSI Summer Experience Visiting Faculty Co-Director.
