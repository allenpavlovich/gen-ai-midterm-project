# Michael Johnson

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Mentor:**Brian Nord

**Project Title:**Deep Diagnostics of Convolutional Neural Networks

**Project Description:**My project focused on how to efficiently access fundamental diagnostics to train and optimize CNN’s. I investigated multiple diagnostics programs to determine how they function to help evaluate model performance. However, Testing these diagnostic tools supported my initial hypothesis that these programs didn’t offer easy access to the fundamental diagnostics of a model I was looking for. So I built a diagnostic package that cuts out extraneous features, and with those, the need for external resources or a deep knowledge of coding to provide new and inexperienced users with the fundamental diagnostics they need.
