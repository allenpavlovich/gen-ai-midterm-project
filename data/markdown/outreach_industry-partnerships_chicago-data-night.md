# Chicago Data Night

A monthly series that bridges the gap between industry and academia to facilitate connection and foster innovation.

!Chicago Data Night is a monthly speaker series co-hosted by the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu), [ChiData](https://uchi-db.github.io/chidatasite/), and [Drive Capital](https://www.drivecapital.com). The event brings together the analytical rigor of academia with the practical insights of industry professionals to unlock new pathways for discovery and development with the broader community.

“Collaboration between industry and academia is essential for driving innovation and addressing real-world challenges. Events like Chicago Data Night create invaluable opportunities for us to exchange ideas, share insights, and explore the practical applications of our research. Together, we can bridge the gap between theory and practice, ensuring that our work has a meaningful impact on both sectors.” Raul Castro Fernandez, ChiData Lead and event organizer.
