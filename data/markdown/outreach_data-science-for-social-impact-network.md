# Data Science for Social Impact Network

A consortium of diverse higher education partners working to broaden participation in STEM and amplify social impact through data science.

The Data Science for Social Impact (DSSI) Network is a consortium of diverse higher education partners, including historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), minority-serving institutions (MSIs), and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), working to amplify social impact through data science. It is a collaborative effort to broaden participation in the data talent pipeline, serve  communities, and maximize opportunities for scalability and transferability of this new model.

## DSSI Summer Experience

The [Data Science Social Impact Summer Experience](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/data-science-for-social-impact-network/summer-experience/) is an immersive 8-week paid summer research program hosted at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute. [Learn more here](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/data-science-for-social-impact-network/summer-experience/), with more information about the Summer 2025 program coming this winter.

## Capacity Accelerator Network

DSSI builds on the work of the [Capacity Accelerator Network (CAN)](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/capacity-accelerator-network/capacity-accelerator-network/), funded by [data.org](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://data.org__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!5DHy5cRm4dLFHyqsHGvkXXOUc3f1BslwrREM0uUoWbENC2pOYw_rcVMkHkZ0Ti9HG_24Imumd5tZ-yTciTG_9LyTmAI$) and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth in 2022-2023. CAN partners included Howard University, Harry S Truman College – City Colleges of Chicago, Morehouse College, University of Texas San Antonio, North Carolina State University, Fresno State, University of Illinois Chicago, and University of Chicago. The network co-authored the [*Data Science for Social Impact in Higher Education* Playbook](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://data.org/playbooks/data-science-for-social-impact-in-higher-education/__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!5DHy5cRm4dLFHyqsHGvkXXOUc3f1BslwrREM0uUoWbENC2pOYw_rcVMkHkZ0Ti9HG_24Imumd5tZ-yTciTG_4aZZkAU$).
