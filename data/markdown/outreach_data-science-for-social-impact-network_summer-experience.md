# Data Science for Social Impact Summer Experience

The Data Science for Social Impact (DSSI) Summer Experience is an immersive 8-week paid summer research program at the University of Chicago.

*Applications for the 2025 DSSI Summer Experience are now open! Students from the University of Chicago and [partnering institutions](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/data-science-for-social-impact-network/) may apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYbKAl3Lurx3nJVzFprR9i7UmwShUK0vISIv32AR7MTkWyYQ/viewform).*

The DSSI Summer Experience is an 8-week paid research program for undergraduate students early in their data science education that includes intensive coursework, applied research training, and data science applications. During the program, students work in teams on social impact data science projects with external partners from climate, health, policy, human rights, financial inclusion, and other organizations. Students hone their data science skills in research methods and teamwork, while learning how to engage with a real-world data science problem.

The DSSI Summer Experience was created in 2023 in partnership with the faculty from the [Data Science for Social Impact Network](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/data-science-for-social-impact-network/): City Colleges of Chicago; California State Fresno; Howard University; Morehouse College; North Carolina State University; University of Illinois, Chicago; University of Texas, San Antonio; and University of Chicago Data Science Institute.
