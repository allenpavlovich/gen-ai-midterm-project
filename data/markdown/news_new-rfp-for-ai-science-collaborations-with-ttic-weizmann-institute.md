# New RFP for AI + Science Collaborations with TTIC, Weizmann Institute

**Update: The deadline for this opportunity has been extended to July 11th.**

Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS), University of Chicago (UChicago), and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC) scholars are invited to submit joint proposals for collaborative projects focusing on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Materials Sciences or Health Sciences and Biology. The overall goal of this program is to initiate and support collaborations among WIS, UChicago, and TTIC in these specific research areas. Research projects must advance both the scientific domain and the foundations of AI.

Projects may focus on broad and cross-cutting themes of relevance to:

* AI + Health & Biology: How can AI improve our ability to understand the rules of life, from the molecular scale to multicellular organisms and ecosystems? Topics include (but are not limited to) analysis of microbial communities; biomedical imaging; protein and chromatin structure and function; analysis of electronic health records.
* AI + Materials Science: How can AI be leveraged to predict the properties and guide the design and synthesis of new materials? Topics include (but are not limited to) prediction of materials structure and properties from both data and physical principles; incorporating physics knowledge into AI systems; using AI to emulate PDE models of materials; analysis of microscopy data using computer vision.

More information and the application can be found [here](https://global.uchicago.edu/wis/ai-science-rfp). Please contact [data-science@uchicago.edu](mailto:data-science@uchicago.edu) with questions about potential partners.
