# Data4All High School Bridge Workshop

Introducing Chicago high schoolers to data science research and inspiring them to consider careers in data science and AI.

[\*Click here for information on how to apply for Data4All.\*](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/data4all/apply/)

Data4All engages high school students in data and coding challenges. Our goal is to create a continuous, evolving computer science pathway for students, allowing them to smoothly transition from the basics of computing through high school to college and beyond.

Activities at the workshop include:

* Learning the Python programming language (no prior knowledge of Python necessary)
* Conducting inquiry-driven research in small groups
* Training on how to investigate data problems and present findings
* Developing critical collaboration, problem-solving, and communication skills

Data4All is open to high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors who have completed Algebra 1. The program lasts 8 weeks, with students meeting on Saturdays at the University of Chicago campus in Hyde Park, Chicago.

#### OVERVIEW

The Data4All High School Bridge Workshop was developed to serve as a transition from introductory computer science classes to data science research. The workshop introduces students to the data science research lifecycle, essential computational skills needed for data analysis and visualization, and provides training on how to communicate their findings. The workshop focuses on creating a continuous learning environment from students’ structured classroom studies to more experimental, inquiry-driven research work in small groups.

#### MOTIVATION

In most Chicago Public High Schools (CPS), students’ exposure to computer science is limited to one computer science survey course, with limited exposure to advanced topics such as artificial intelligence, data science, or application of computer science to societal issues. This lack of opportunity continues to be perpetuated when students seek internships and other employment experiences and do not have the confidence in their own knowledge to see computer science, data science or artificial intelligence as a possible career pathway for themselves. To address this need, a team of researchers and educators from Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago developed a data science bridge workshop that supports students from Chicago’s South Side community to develop a deeper understanding of data science and grow a tangible skill set that is grounded in scientific projects, real-world datasets, and professional tools. Through this program students will explore the foundational concepts of computer science and data science, working with authentic and complex datasets and leveraging principles of AI to gain insights from data and make predictions.

#### WORKSHOP FOCUS & APPROACH

The workshop is taught by using case studies that contain a real-world scientific challenge (i.e. COVID-19), an authentic data set and associated professional tools. The case studies are supplied from data generated by scientific research projects from the three institutions. Using the Python language, students explore data structures with an emphasis on multidimensional arrays, manipulating and visualizing them with commonly used libraries in scientific computing such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. The datasets provide students with many of the challenges associated with scientific data and provide them with the skills to perform statistical analysis and prediction all the while exploring real-world problems. The workshop models the collaborative nature of computer science by situating students in teams with guidance and support of staff, including undergraduate and graduate mentors from the three institutions.
