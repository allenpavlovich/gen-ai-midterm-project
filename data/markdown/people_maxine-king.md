**Project: Research Sharing in JupyterHub with Chameleon Cloud**

**Mentors/Lab:** [Kate Keahey](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~keahey/) & [Jason Anderson](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason_Anderson35)/[Chameleon Project Nimbus Team](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Scientific Computing // Systems & Architecture

Working with the Nimbus team, we integrated Chameleon’s JupyterHub with Zenodo to make it easier to share, publish, and import research notebooks. I worked on making it easier to share notebook-based research in and out of the JupyterHub environment on Argonne’s Chameleon open testbed. I wrote a full-scale, front-end, and back-end publishing extension for JupyterLab, adjusted the JupyterHub configuration to make it easy to import notebooks, and created a Django website to allow users to share and browse research.

***Project News:***The [poster](http://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=rpost224&sess=sess348) for this project, titled “Sharing and Replicability of Notebook-Based Research on Open Testbeds”, was accepted at the [SC19](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/) International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis.
