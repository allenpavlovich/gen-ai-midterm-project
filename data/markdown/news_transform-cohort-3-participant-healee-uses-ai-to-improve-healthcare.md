Healee: Applying AI to Improve the Consumer Experience in Healthcare

!

When looking at the consumer experience in industries such as banking, shopping, and travel, it’s easy to notice how unfriendly the experience often is in healthcare.

The [Healee](http://healee.com) team, which includes three cofounders, Plamen Petrov, Hristo Kosev, and Josif Dishliev, aims to change that by bringing the same caliber of consumer experience that people are accustomed to in non-healthcare environments to healthcare by applying AI.

“We believe that patients expect and deserve not only affordable and quality medical care, but also consumer-grade intuitive experience, continuously available convenience, intelligent digital care navigators, reminders, and communicators,” said Petrov. “In short, we want to remove the complexity of healthcare and make it easy and frictionless.”

Through the use of AI, Healee creates clinically actionable insights for clients, continuously tests to streamline all actions for users, and is deeply configurable so providers can create the exact experience they want for their patients and their operations.

“Healthcare, and patient engagement specifically, is well suited for the implementation of AI. Clinical operations today are producing large amounts of data that are difficult to make actionable because much of the related work is still being done manually by care coordinators,” said Petrov. “Healee tackles this challenge by taking this latent data and making it clinically actionable, intuitive, and convenient while streamlining clinical operations.”

The team has already experienced promising traction in Europe, powering one of the largest patient-matching platforms that serves 1 million patients a month. In the last 18 months, Healee has expanded to the U.S. where it now serves a number of providers and has built a robust pipeline of interested provider organizations.

In the next 5 years, the team expects to exceed a $1 billion market cap serving healthcare providers with patient-focused AI engagement tools that make receiving healthcare as easy as shopping online.

AI-powered consumer experience and intelligent self-serve navigation is in its infancy and will disrupt and transform the antiquated, bureaucratic, and confusing patient-provider interactions. And Healee hopes to be on that front line.
