Program

# DSI Summer Lab

A summer research opportunity for undergraduate students (and Chicago-area high school students) focusing on rigorous, applied, interdisciplinary data science research and rooted in a cohort community.

*Applications for Summer 2025 are now closed. If you have already submitted an application, we will let you know your admissions decision in March.*

The Data Science Institute Summer Lab program is an immersive 8-week paid **summer research program** at the University of Chicago. In the program, undergraduate students (and Chicago-area high school students) are paired with data science mentors in various domains, including: computer science, data science, social science, climate and energy policy, public policy, materials science, and biomedical research. Through this pairing the research assistant will engage with and hone their skills in research methodologies, practices, and teamwork. We encourage participation from a broad range of students, and require no prior research experience to apply. This year’s program will run from June 16 – August 8, 2025.

For answers to many common questions, please consult our [FAQ page](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/faq/). If your question is not answered there, contact Molly Long ([mrlong@uchicago.edu](mailto:mrlong@uchicago.edu)) for additional questions related to Summer Lab.

*Learn about another DSI summer program, Data Science for Social Impact Summer Experience, [here](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/data-science-for-social-impact-network/summer-experience/). DSSI is open to undergraduate students early in their data science careers who attend UChicago and certain partner institutions.*
