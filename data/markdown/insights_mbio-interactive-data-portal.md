# mBio Interactive Data Portal

A collaboration between the University of Chicago, University of San Francisco, and University of Cambridge (through support from 11th Hour Project) gathers and analyzes data on the funding, location, and research status for more than 230 GM crop varieties in Africa.

[Image: map of Africa generated by mbio]](https://forms.gle/pGyfSoTJqJHvZCCU6)The mBio Project exists to expand knowledge of genetically modified (GM) crop development on the African continent. The project began in 2020 as a way to research the historical and current state of GM crops in Africa. Since then, it has expanded to explore the projects, narratives, and financial partnerships that undergird GM crop development.

The databases are designed to reflect the dynamic and changing nature of GM crop research and development on the continent, and users can submit a new entry, or correct to an existing entry [here](https://forms.gle/pGyfSoTJqJHvZCCU6).
