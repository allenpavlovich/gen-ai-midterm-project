# CDAC Opens Autumn 2019 Discovery Grant Call for Proposals

As part of CDAC's mission to support and amplify data science research at the University of Chicago, we are pleased to announce our Autumn 2019 call for proposals.

**Solicitation: [CDAC Discovery Grants – Autumn 2019 RFP](/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CDAC-Discovery-Grants-Autumn-2019-RFP.pdf)**

CDAC Discovery Grants provide risk-tolerant seed funding for innovative data science projects that are interdisciplinary, ambitious, and expand the boundaries of existing scholarship. During the Autumn 2019 cycle, we will support two categories of early-stage projects:

* **Collaborative Research Projects:** Research grants will be offered for early-stage projects executed by multidisciplinary teams comprising researchers from multiple departments/units. Successful projects will advance data-driven applications, models, algorithms, and platforms as is not already being done in your field today. Awards should ideally be used to perform initial work that leads to future external funding. Awards will be available for up to $100,000 for a period of 12 months.
* **Exploratory Convenings:**This opportunity welcomes proposals that support workshops, invited speaker talks, working groups, or other convenings focused on novel, interdisciplinary, data-driven or computing research topics. Awards should provide planning support to facilitate the development of grant proposals or collaborative projects. Awards will be available for up to $15,000 for a period of 12 months.

Please review the current call for proposals for more details and eligibility requirements. See project examples from our previous Discovery Grant cycle [here](/news/cdac-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-data-science-discovery-projects/).

We encourage all members of the University community with PI status to apply. Applications for both funding programs can be found online at [InfoReady](https://uchicago.infoready4.com). **Submissions are due at 11:59 pm CT on Friday, November 1, 2019**. The earliest project start date is January 6, 2019, coinciding with the start of the Winter 2020 quarter.

**PLEASE NOTE:** There are separate applications for each type of proposal (Collaborative Research Projects & Exploratory Convenings). Please be sure to use the correct application for your proposal type.

We are hosting a [**Proposer’s Day** on Tuesday, October 15th](/events/cdac-discovery-grant-proposers-day), from 3:30-5:00pm in John Crerar Library Rm. 390, to provide potential applicants with preliminary, informal feedback on their proposal ideas, as well as networking opportunities with potential collaborators and student researchers within the data science community. Register to attend and/or present your idea [here.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cdac-discovery-grants-proposers-day-tickets-73606502029?ref=estw)

Due to the volume of applications we receive, we will be unable to provide reviewer feedback on applications that are not funded.

We look forward to your application. Please use the links below to apply:
