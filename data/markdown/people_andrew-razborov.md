# Andrew Razborov

High Schooler, University of Chicago Laboratory Schools

**Project:** Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem with Dynamic Trees

**Mentors:** [Lorenzo Orecchia](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/lorenzo-orecchia/), Department of Computer Science

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning // Algorithms & Optimization // Computer Science Theory

**Project Description:**Andrew Razborov is a junior at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. This summer, he worked with [Prof. Lorenzo Orecchia](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/lorenzo-orecchia/) and [Konstantinos Ameranis](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~kameranis/) on a project working to solve the max flow, min cut problem using dynamic trees, which maintain paths from the root to the source as a forest of vortex disjoint trees.
