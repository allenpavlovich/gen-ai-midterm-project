Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project: Password Reuse & Vulnerability Detection**

**Mentor/Lab:** [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/)/[SUPERGroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/contact.html)

**Research Area Keywords:** Security & Privacy // Human-Computer Interaction

In this project, in collaboration with UChicago IT Services, we leverage publicly available data breaches and password modification strategies to generate password guesses for current and previous UChicago accounts, and run a simulated attack to assess the vulnerability of UChicago accounts to password guessing attacks. Information is obtained from users who are identified as vulnerable in this simulated attack using anonymous online surveys. Attitudes, intentions, and planned behavior change are surveyed in an effort to design interventions that promote better password security habits.
