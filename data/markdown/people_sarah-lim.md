# Sarah Lim

High Schooler, Lane Tech College Prep

**Mentors:**Daniel Grzenda & [David Uminsky](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-uminsky/)

**Project Title:**Social Impact Track – PalmWatch

**Project Description:**Built a model in Jupyter Lab that compares correlations between columns of risk scores,  
created an overlaid histogram of risk scores per mill type, found the risk scores for mills from 2001-2019 using a function, found the year each mill was certified and used this certification column and the risk score columns to build a random forest. The Random Forest predicts for every single year whether or not mills are certified. I also built a logistic regression to predicts what type of certification they have, if they are not certified or certified.
