# IoT Inspector

An open-source desktop tool that automatically discovers IoT devices and analyzes their network traffic to help you identify security and privacy issues.

An open-source desktop tool with a one-click install process that automatically discovers IoT devices and analyzes their network traffic. IoT Inspector helps you identify security and privacy issues with graphs and tables, and requires minimal technical skills and no special hardware. Use it to quickly inspect devices (e.g., from your computer) or continuously monitor your network (e.g., from a Raspberry Pi).

IoT Inspector is a project by researchers at Princeton University, New York University, University of Chicago, Georgia Tech, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, KU Leuven, and Colgate University. Learn more at [iotinspector.org](https://iotinspector.org/).
