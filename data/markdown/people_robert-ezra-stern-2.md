# Robert Ezra Stern

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Mentor:**Nicholas Marchio

**Project Title:**Interactively Mapping Urban Human Development

**Project Description:**We studied the deployment of encrypted DNS outside of the mainstream resolvers by measuring DNS query response times and ping times for resolvers located across the world. We compared non-mainstream resolvers to mainstream resolvers, such as Google and Cloudflare, to better understand the reliability of the lesser known resolvers and the DNS encrypted ecosystem as a whole.
