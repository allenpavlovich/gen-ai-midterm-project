# Internet of Things (IoT) Lab

The DSI Internet of Things (IoT) Lab is a resource for UChicago students and faculty to experiment with the latest devices and datasets for research and applications.

*Am I getting what I paid for from my internet subscription?*  
*What happens when one of your home connected devices is compromised?*  
*What exactly happens when you play your favorite Netflix video?*  
*How can we watch the watchers?*

The **Internet Of Things (IoT)** market is predicted to grow at $520B in valuation by 2021, more than double the $235B spent in 2017, according to Forbes. The increasing popularity of these “smart” IoT consumer devices raises many interesting research questions. At the DSI IoT Lab, we replicate your home broadband network inside an experimental laboratory to study security, privacy, and network performance. By hosting several IoT devices (powered by [CableLabs](https://www.cablelabs.com/)), we provide a unique opportunity for you to experiment with new and existing datasets, apply data science and machine learning techniques to uncover new insights and valuable information, or build your new application or research project.

We leverage the compute power of **Single Board Computers (SBC)** to run applications built by students for various applications, including network traffic monitoring, internet performance, security and privacy research. With an isolated and dedicated internet connection, powered by **Comcast**, we connect all devices through a single WiFi connection.
