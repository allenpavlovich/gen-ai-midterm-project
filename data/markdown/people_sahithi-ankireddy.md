**Project Title:**Driving Autonomous Cars From Edge to Cloud with CHI@Edge

**Project Description:**We created a cloud-based pipeline for driving autonomous cars via Chameleon’s CHI@edge testbed. Specifically, we developed base containers with libraries for access to a car’s interfaces and launched them onboard small, remote-control cars in addition to exploring the effect of different machine learning models on the performance of the car.
