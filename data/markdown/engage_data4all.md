# Data4All Expands Its Impact

In an increasingly data-driven world, it’s crucial that the next generation of leaders, researchers, and innovators are equipped with the knowledge and tools to navigate this complex landscape. The Data4All High School Bridge Workshop (Data4All)  is on a mission to do just that by introducing high school students in the Chicagoland area to data science within a framework of scientific reasoning. In November, Data4All completed its sixth program cycle, engaging 30 high school students from across the City of Chicago in eight weeks of instruction. Since its launch in the spring of 2021, Data4All has successfully engaged a total of 138 students from 47 high schools.

#### **What is Data4All?**

Data4All helps students grow in their data science skills and transition from introductory classes to data science research. The workshop introduces students to the data science research lifecycle, shares essential computational skills needed for analysis and visualization, and provides training on how to communicate their findings. Using public health case studies and real-world data sets, students apply statistical analysis and computational problem solving while learning Python, a widely-used programming language.

#### **Impact on Students and Mentors**

While engaging in project-based learning, students also expand their understanding of data science careers and educational pathways through interactive guest lectures. During the recent Fall 2024 workshop, students heard from various guest speakers, ranging from academic researchers to industry experts at Google and Netflix. Joshua McKeever, a PhD candidate in the Committee on Molecular Metabolism and Nutrition at University of Chicago, served as an instructor and guest speaker during both the fall 2023 and 2024 sessions.  “The Data4all curriculum allows students to experience the overlap between data science, reasoning, and the smaller analyses that each person does throughout their daily lives,” McKeever reflected, “It’s amazing to see how the students’ perspectives of data science change over the course of the program.”

Additionally, students make meaningful connections with undergraduate college students who serve as near-peer mentors and support for the Data4All participants. This fall, five UChicago college students worked alongside Data4All participants supporting their learning and social interactions. When asked about his experience as an undergraduate mentor, UChicago student Yannick Tanyi shared, “The most rewarding part of being a mentor has been seeing the transformation in the students’ attitudes and engagement— watching them dive into the activities, collaborate with each other, and truly enjoy what they’re learning has been incredibly fulfilling.”

#### **Data Science Reasoning**

While many data science courses and bootcamps emphasize technical upskilling by teaching statistical concepts and coding, Data4All takes this a step further by situating these topics within the context of scientific inquiry. Created as a didactic tool to enhance critical thinking, the [Data Science Reasoning Framework](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DSRF_title.pdf) (DSRF) teaches students the investigative and iterative process of generating knowledge. The DSRF is constantly referenced throughout the Data4All curriculum to accentuate the importance of validating claims using data and evidence-based reasoning. By participating in this program, students develop analytical approaches for assessing information, enhancing their data literacy and problem-solving skills. “This experience was valuable because I learned a lot of new skills and concepts that I find myself using in my daily life, such as correlation versus causation when connecting topics, and p-values in probability,” said Lauren Lam, a student at Walter Payton College Preparatory High School and Data4All Fall 2024 participant.

Data4All has been made possible through the collaboration of several contributors. Dr. Tyler Skluzacek, a research scientist at the Oak Ridge National Lab who completed his doctoral research in computer science at the University of Chicago, along with John Domyancich and Bethany Frank from Argonne National Laboratory’s Educational Programs and Outreach team, developed a comprehensive instructor guide and Python notebooks with the goal of creating an open and accessible curriculum. Materials can be found on the Data4All [Github repository](https://github.com/uchicago-dsi/data4all). Dr. Julia Koschinsky, Executive Director of the Center for Spatial Data Science; Dr. Evelyn Campbell, Program Manager at the Data Science Institute and Data4All Lead; and Demaris Hernandez, 12th Grade Math Teacher at South LA College Prep, further refined curricular materials and approaches for inclusive pedagogy. We gratefully acknowledge the support from the Successful Pathways from School to Work initiative of the University of Chicago, funded by [Hymen Milgrom Supporting Organization](https://voices.uchicago.edu/successfulpathways/the-hymen-milgrom-supporting-organization/).

#### **Looking Ahead**

Data4All is equipping students with the technical tools they will need to succeed while also empowering them with critical thinking and scientific reasoning skills. The next Data4All workshop will run in Spring 2025, with applications opening in February 2025.
