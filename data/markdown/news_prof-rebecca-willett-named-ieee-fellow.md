# Prof. Rebecca Willett Named IEEE Fellow

[!Rebecca Willett](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/rebecca-willett/), Professor in the UChicago Departments of Computer Science and Statistics and Faculty Director for AI at the Data Science Institute, was elevated to IEEE Fellow in [the organization’s 2022 class](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/fellows/2022-ieee-fellows-class.pdf). Willett was recognized by IEEE “for contributions to the foundations of computational imaging and large-scale data science.” Earlier this year, she was also named [a fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/willett-siam/).

Since [joining UChicago in 2018](https://cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/new-cs-stats-prof.-rebecca-willett-explores-foundations-applications-of-dat), Willett has extended her work on the applications and foundations of data science, working with [climate scientists](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/data-science-collaboration-aims-to-find-next-el-nino/) and [leading a UChicago/Argonne project](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/ai-models/) that will apply artificial intelligence to accelerate the scientific simulation of complex physical systems. She helped bring UChicago into the multi-institutional [Institute for Foundations of Data Science (IFDS)](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/tripods-ifds/) with collaborators in Statistics and the Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics (CCAM).

Willett has also spoken to national audiences about the importance of artificial intelligence and data science research at universities. Read about and watch her keynote address at the 2019 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Innovation XLab Artificial Intelligence Summit [here](https://cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/ai-xlab/).
