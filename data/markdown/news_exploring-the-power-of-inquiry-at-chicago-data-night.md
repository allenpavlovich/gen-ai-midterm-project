# Exploring the Power of Inquiry at Chicago Data Night

The Data Science Institute, ChiData, and Drive Capital partner to bridge academia and industry in monthly speaker series.

!In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, the collaboration between industry and academic research has never been more crucial. Chicago Data Night’s goal is to bridge the gap, creating opportunities to foster innovation and drive advancements to tackle real-world challenges. The outcome of an innovative partnership between [Drive Capital](https://www.drivecapital.com/), [ChiData](https://uchi-db.github.io/chidatasite/), and the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/), the event series brings together the analytical rigor of academia with the practical insights of industry professionals, helping our broader community unlock new pathways for discovery and development.

“Innovation is fueled through community building. That’s why we’re focused on creating opportunities for Chicago’s tech scene. Our partnership with UChicago on Chicago Data Night is a great example, bringing together the data science community at the intersection of technology and industry.” — Landon W. Campbell, Chicago General Manager, Drive Capital

At the most recent Data Night on October 16, **Neal Sample, Chief Information Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance**, challenged the audience to reconsider their approach to problem-solving in his talk *“Why Asking the Right Questions Matters More Than Having All the Answers.”* He emphasized that, rather than racing to find solutions, the true catalyst for innovation lies in the quality of the questions we ask. 

!Sample drew from his extensive experience in various industries, sharing real-world scenarios where thoughtful questioning has led to remarkable advancements. He illustrated how the ability to ask the right questions can reshape technological landscapes and unlock new possibilities. This theme struck a chord with attendees, many of whom are navigating complex data challenges in their own fields.

The event not only provided a platform for learning but also fostered a sense of community among participants, with professionals and students from diverse backgrounds coming together.

“Collaboration between industry and academia is essential for driving innovation and addressing real-world challenges. Events like Chicago Data Night create invaluable opportunities for us to exchange ideas, share insights, and explore the practical applications of our research. Together, we can bridge the gap between theory and practice, ensuring that our work has a meaningful impact on both sectors.” Raul Castro Fernandez, ChiData Lead and event organizer.

!For those interested in joining this vibrant community, Chicago Data Night is held monthly, and attendance is free. The next event will be held on Wednesday, November 13, where [James Nowell, CTO and Co-Founder of Ezbot AI company](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/events/chicago-data-night-james-nowell-ezbotai/) will discuss innovative solutions using Events and Domain-Driven Design.

Future events will continue to spotlight industry leaders who share their insights on pressing topics around data science, AI, and technological innovations. As the Chicago data community continues to grow, these events remain a crucial hub for collaboration and innovation in the industry.
