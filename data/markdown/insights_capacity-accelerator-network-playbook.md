# Capacity Accelerator Network Playbook

Made in collaboration with Data.org, this playbook was designed to help expand opportunities for social impact data science learning

[***Data Science for Social Impact in Higher Education: First Steps***](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://data.org/playbooks/data-science-for-social-impact-in-higher-education/__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!-vW_m_vscU2ZOUs-Jh1Z665pCsQQNtsl9ll_Sq323R2_MWkMUxn3ZTJorQhP-duz93rq4jiSAQ2aNteRiHITafNpj3U$) is a playbook designed to help expand opportunities for social impact data science learning and teaching. The Playbook highlights opportunities for courses and course modules, extra-curricular internships, and events to support efforts to bring social impact data science to institutions of different sizes, structures, and student bodies. It includes extensive examples from our work here at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute. The Playbook was co-created by partners in the [Capacity Accelerator Network](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/capacity-accelerator-network/), funded by [data.org](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://data.org__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!-vW_m_vscU2ZOUs-Jh1Z665pCsQQNtsl9ll_Sq323R2_MWkMUxn3ZTJorQhP-duz93rq4jiSAQ2aNteRiHITAnSCUwc$), a consortium of higher education partners including public universities, community colleges, HBCUs, Hispanic-Servicing Institutions (HSIs), and private universities across the U.S.
