Program

# Summer 2024

The Data Science for Social Impact (DSSI) Summer Experience is an immersive 8-week paid summer research program at the University of Chicago.

## 2024 Research Projects

DSSI students work on real-world data science projects. Many projects come from DSI’s partnership with the [11th Hour Project,](https://11thhourproject.org/) a program of the Schmidt Family Foundation, where we serve as the [centralized software and data science hub](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/11th-hour-project/) for social impact grantees and nonprofit organizations.

This year’s research theme was natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLM), led by [Satadisha Saha Bhowmick, PhD](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/satadisha-saha-bhowmick/), 2024 Summer Research Director and Preceptor at the UChicago Data Science Institute.

### **Text Classification via Prompt Generation – Center for Good Food Purchasing**

The Center for Good Food Purchasing reviews receipts and invoices to track the kind of foods that public institutions typically purchase. The Center staff categorizes food items and rates them on factors like sustainability, worker treatment, and animal welfare. Institutions can then review these ratings when making future purchasing decisions. Using different methods of natural language processing, the project goal is to automate this food labeling task.

Yannick Tanyi, Joanna John, and Atuwatse Okorodudu took on this task using prompt generation. The team employed different prompting methods to train their large language models in classifying food products, such as zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation. They also utilized Llama3 and OpenAI GPT models to compare cost-effectiveness and performance. While students observed that the use of OpenAI GPT provided higher accuracy in grouping food products, RAG implementation greatly increased performance of the Llama3 model.

### **Fine Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) – Center for Good Food Purchasing**

Cielo Martinez Flores, Perfect Sylvester, and Alondra Flores utilized traditional fine tuning approaches for text classification. The team strived to build a classifier that could successfully classify each product into its food group, category, and subtype with at least 90% accuracy. To meet this goal, students performed an extensive data cleaning protocol that included deduplicating data, simplifying labels, spell-checking, and filtering to allow for accurate downstream sampling. Following this, a roBERTa model was used with a custom trainer to achieve 92% in overall accuracy.

### **Quotation Extraction – The mBio Project**

The mBio Project explores how African media discusses biotechnology and agriculture using textual data in published articles from the last 25 years. Since its founding in 2020, the project aims to understand the historical and current narratives and understanding of genetically modified crops on the continent.

Students Malee Her, Caitlin Hamer, Michelle Cobaxin, and Catie Lutz utilized various techniques to perform sentiment analysis on numerous African media outlets**,** such as Quotation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Coreference Resolution (Coref), and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). Using a dataset consisting of more than 1,800 quotes from over 2 million articles the team was able to illuminate advantages and disadvantages of using OpenAI, spaCy (transformer), and BERT models for NER, with BERT having 98% accuracy. The spaCy model performed better than OpenAI in Coref, allowing for identification of entities in 58% of the data. The team’s work may be used for further refinement of the utilized models to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the research and bring the work closer to practical application.

### **Fine Tuning for Text Summarization – BankTrack**

BankTrack is the international tracking, campaigning, and civil society support organization targeting private sector commercial banks and the activities they finance. BankTrack combines twenty years of critical yet constructive engagement with banks and banking initiatives. Form 8-K is a required report that companies must file with the SEC to announce major events that shareholders should know about, such as incurring debt. Using data from these forms, BankTrack aims to illuminate pertinent information regarding the monetary expenditures of financial institutions and the corresponding ramifications in order to inform the public.

Jonathan Garcia, Diego Sarria, Zaina Khalil, and Jack Sanderson worked together to distill complex text in approximately 100 8-K forms into informative summaries. The team constructed the training label summaries through heuristically-generated summaries and the labels and text were then used to train Long Encoder Decoder (LED) and LLaMa large language models (LLMs). After training, refining, and adjusting parameters for these models, the group found that both models were able to create summaries that were much more brief than the original text while retaining approximately 90% of the necessary information.  A copy of their poster can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ERqrteQu068YXEHuv7RWNba3qjwO8J95/view?usp=sharing).

**Bio:**Amanda Kube is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Division of Computational and Data Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis working with Dr. Sanmay Das in the Department of Computer Science and Dr. Patrick Fowler in the Brown School. She received her B.S. in Psychological and Brain Sciences and Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics from Washington University in St. Louis where she also received an M.S. in Data Analytics and Statistics. Her research interests involve the intersection of computation and the social sciences. Her current work combines machine learning and human decision-making to inform fair and efficient service allocations for homeless families.

**Talk Title:**Integrating Human Priorities and Data-Driven Improvements in Allocation of Scarce Homeless Services to Households in Need

**Talk Abstract:**Homelessness is a major public health issue in the United States that has gained visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite efforts at the federal level, rates of homelessness are not decreasing. Homeless services are a scarce public resource and current allocation systems have not been thoroughly investigated. Algorithmic techniques excel at modeling complex interactions between features and therefore have potential to model effects of homeless services at the individual level. These models can reason counterfactually about the effects of different services on each household and resulting predictions can be used for matching households to services. The ability to model heterogeneity in treatment effects of services provides the potential for “precision public health” where allocation of services is based on data-driven predictions of which service will lead to better outcomes. I discuss the scarce resource allocation problem as it applies to homeless service delivery, and the ability to improve upon the current allocation system using algorithmic techniques. I compare prediction algorithms to each other as well as to the ability of the general public to make these decisions. As homeless services are scarce public goods, it is vital to ensure allocations are not only efficient, but fair and ethical. I discuss efforts to ensure fair decisions and to understand how people prioritize households who should receive scarce homeless services. I also discuss future work and next steps as well as policy implications.
