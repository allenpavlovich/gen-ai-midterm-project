# Philanthropic Giving

**Consider giving to support the mission of the Data Science Institute.**

The University of Chicago is defined by the bold willingness to ask the hardest questions, challenge conventions, and shape the future of knowledge. Today, as data science and AI revolutionize every field, we have the opportunity and the responsibility to lead. The support of our partners allows UChicago to house cutting-edge research labs and make breakthroughs that redefine medicine, climate science, public policy, and beyond.

**Your company can be a part of the groundbreaking work of the DSI and cultivate ideas that translate into real-world impact in fields as diverse as climate science and public policy.!**

An investment in the University is an investment in the research that shapes our world today and the students who will lead across industry tomorrow. Giving can be directed toward scholarships, fellowships, technology, office space, and more. These partnerships allow companies to leverage the resources of the University to spur on transformation in their fields.

Corporate giving can take many forms. We encourage you to [get in touch](mailto:annebrown@uchicago.edu) to develop a philanthropic plan that best suits your organization.
