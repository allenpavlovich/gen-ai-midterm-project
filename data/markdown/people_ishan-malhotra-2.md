# Jamar Sullivan

Formerly: Gwendolyn Brooks College Prep
Currently: The University of Chicago

**Project:**Latent Attention & Training ML Algorithms

**Mentors:** [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/), [SUPERGroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning // Security & Privacy

**Project Description:**Jamar Sullivan is an incoming freshman at the University of Chicago studying computer science and astrophysics, and recent high school graduate from Gwendolyn Brooks College Prep. This summer, he continued work with [Prof. Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/) in the [SUPERGroup Lab](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/) to explore the difference in machine learning models’ performance when using human-collected vs. machine-learned attention. The project created a user interface that requires users to select words that they believe indicate the sentiment of a movie review, and then created a model that would learn the indicative words in a movie review dataset. It’s understood that attention can lead to greater performance in machine learning models, but collecting human information means that it is possible to collect more data from the same sized dataset, and get high accuracy with a smaller model.
