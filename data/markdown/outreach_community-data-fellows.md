Program

# Community Data Fellows

Pairing students interested in the nexus of technology and public policy with local community organizations to leverage data and technology in service of their mission.

The Community Data Fellows program pairs local, community-based nonprofit organizations with UChicago graduate students who possess skills in technology and policy analysis. Through this program, we meet social impact organizations where they are on the data spectrum. Fellows work with organizations to determine how best to use data, build data capacity across program staff, and scope projects that advance the mission. By understanding the organization’s data capacity, Fellows are able to create solutions that persist and add value at the completion of the work.

The Community Data Fellows program is supported in part by the [Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN),](https://pitcases.org/) an initiative of [New America’s](https://www.newamerica.org/) Public Interest Technology Program.
