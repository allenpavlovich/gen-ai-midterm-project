    Katie Malone/Bob Montgomery/Jonathan Ozeran -  Tempus

    **Katie****Malone** is Senior Director of Data Science at Tempus, where she specializes in Tempus’s data licensing and clinical trials businesses, bringing Tempus’s clinical and molecular oncology data to bear in developing more effective cancer therapies. Before Tempus, she worked at Civis Analytics. From 2014-2020 he was the host of Linear Digressions, a podcast about data science, and she has taught courses on data science for Udacity and the University of Chicago Graham School. She has a PhD in physics from Stanford University.

    **Bob Montgomery** is Director of Data Science at Tempus, where he leads three machine learning teams working with medical images (Pathology, Radiology, and Cell Imaging) and leads ML Ops activities and software development for the Data Science organization. Prior to joining Tempus, he was Director of Data Science at Uptake and Principal Data Scientist at NORC. He has over 20 years of experience working in statistical analysis and data science and received his MA and ABD in Economics from UC Santa Barbara.

    **Jonathan Ozeran** is Senior Director of Operations at Tempus, where he specializes in search, generative AI and provider-facing tools including Tempus One, an AI-enabled clinical assistant for oncologists. Prior to joining Tempus, he held founding product and engineering leadership roles for a number of companies including Yaro, Yello, and Lextech (an Apple mobility partner) amongst others. From 2013-2017, he taught coursework focused on mobile product design and software development as an Adjunct Lecturer at Northwestern University. He completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan and received his master’s degree from Northwestern University.
