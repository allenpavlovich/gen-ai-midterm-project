Research at the Data Science Institute

DSI research addresses important scientific and societal questions through coordinated advances in applications, models, algorithms, and platforms.

## Research Initiatives

[!](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/)

## [AI + Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/)

A new paradigm of transformational AI-enabled scientific discovery across the physical and biological sciences, advancing core AI principles and training a new generation of diverse interdisciplinary scientists.

[!](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/data-democracy/)

## [Data & Democracy](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/data-democracy/)

A collaboration between the DSI and the Center for Effective Government that conducts cross-disciplinary research, convenes key stakeholders, and circulates and amplifies the findings needed to protect democracy in the digital age.

[!](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/internet-equity/)

## [Internet Equity](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/internet-equity/)

Developing new data science tools to measure broadband access and performance and working with community partners to make high-speed internet accessible to all.
