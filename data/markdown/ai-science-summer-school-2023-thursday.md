* [Agenda](#)

  * [9:30 am - 10:30 am: AI + Genomics (Part 1)](#accordion-tab-0) 

    Anoushka Joglekar - Postdoctoral Researcher, New York Genome Center

    **Dr. Anoushka Joglekar** is a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Gamze Gürsoy at the New York Genome Center and Columbia University. She is working on developing new algorithms to study the 3D structure of the genome, with the hope of parsing small and large-scale differences in the genome architecture of different cell types. Previously, she obtained her PhD from the Tri-Institutional program in Computational Biology and Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. During her time there, she worked in the Tilgner lab in the Department of Neurogenetics where she focused on technology and algorithm development for studying alternative splicing in the brain at the single cell/single-nucleus level.

    While her interest in genomics has always been persistent, she realized over time that there are different ways of tackling questions related to the structural and molecular aspects of function. Long term, she wants to use a combination of statistical and wet-lab approaches to comprehensively study how transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of cells affect function. In general, she gets excited when people push the boundaries of what is known in science, particularly when clever new technologies are involved. She is looking forward to the talks at this summer camp where different frontiers of science are being pushed to new heights with AI and its applications.

    Chibueze Amanchukwu - Neubauer Family Assistant Professor, Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering

    **Chibueze Amanchukwu** is a Neubauer Family Assistant Professor in the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago, and holds a joint appointment at Argonne National Laboratory. His research is focused on sustainable energy, and involves the design, synthesis, and understanding of ion transport in electrolytes for batteries and electrocatalysis. His team is especially interested in correlating bulk solvation properties to electrochemical interfacial phenomena, and they use data science tools coupled with synthesis and novel characterization approaches to answer these questions.

    His work has been recognized with the NSF CAREER Award, ECS-Toyota Young Investigator Fellowship, CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar Award, and the 3M Nontenured Faculty Award. He obtained his PhD in chemical engineering as a NDSEG Fellow at MIT and was a TomKat Center Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University.
