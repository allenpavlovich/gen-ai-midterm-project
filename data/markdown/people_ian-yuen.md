# Ian Yuen

Masters Student, Masters Program in Computer Science, The University of Chicago

**Mentors:**Daniel Grzenda & [David Uminsky](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-uminsky/)

**Project Title:**Social Impact Track – Human Rights Media Analysis

**Project Description:**Working with the UN Human Rights Office (UN OHCHR), my team built a feature extraction and NLP classification pipeline that categorised the credibility level of news articles on human rights incidents. In the pipeline, we used sci-kits learn, hugginface, spaCy, and gensim. The resulting pipeline will streamline the process of human rights analysis for UN analysts.
