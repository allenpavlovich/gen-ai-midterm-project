# Transform Cohort 2 startup Echo Labs raises historic pre-seed funding round

Chicago Inno features story about Transform Cohort member Echo Labs

As AI advancements continue to improve speech-to-text technology, nothing has yet to match the accuracy of human transcription — especially when considering variables in speaking patterns in individuals such as children, second-language speakers, and those with disabilities. And that’s exactly where [Echo Labs](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uchicago.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ec6ce9664cb8d0269d48e1d4c&id=92c8f5ee06&e=3a13b731f2__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!63OcPjAk_tiuxey9uFz8iTdk27DadNHS4w2DDPrG1VxQ8-CmsTbAY4nSibTYUYs-34vaLo3LzenWdLC9AKlRaUIJRYo$) hopes to make an impact, specifically for higher education institutions held to particularly rigid accessibility regulations. This Transform Cohort 2 startup is working to build the first-ever AI that can produce real-time, human-quality transcription — even in adverse conditions, including high-noise environments with multiple speakers or speakers with accents. And now, the early-stage startup has just announced its close of a $7.4M funding round — the largest pre-seed raise ever completed in Chicago. Furthermore, the team shared that it has launched a new educational pilot program to officially introduce its software to a select group of universities.
