# Rituparno Mandal

Associate Professor in Theoretical Physics, Raman Research Institute, Bangalore University

DSI Postdoctoral Scholar 2022-2024

I worked as an AI & Science Post-Doctoral Fellow at the JFI, University of Chicago with Prof. Vincenzo Vitelli. Before coming here I worked with Prof. Peter Sollich as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowat the University of Goettingen, Germany and with Prof. Madan Rao (briefly for a year) as a Simons Career Development Fellow, at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, India, just after I did my Ph.D. I completed my Ph.D. in the theoretical condensed matter physics under the guidance of Prof. Chandan Dasgupta from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru in 2018. My research has primarily focused on theoretical soft-condensed matter physics, spanning diverse areas such as glasses, active matter, and granular/athermal systems, as well as applying machine learning and AI-based tools to soft matter problems. Currently, my work at JFI, involves exploring the collective behavior of self-propelled agents with small neural networks, as well as investigating how to generate complex dynamic self-assembly through physical learning. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, and cooking.
