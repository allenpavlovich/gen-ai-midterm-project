Echoes of laughter and intellectual chatter filled the historic Game Room of the Chicago Athletic Association as online students from the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program gathered for a weekend of connection and discovery. Held at this iconic landmark and on UChicago’s Hyde Park campus, the Spring 2025 Immersion Weekend brought virtual classmates together in person— sparking conversation and a true sense of community.

“Immersion Weekend held at the Chicago Athletic Association was a testament to the strength of the UChicago MS in Applied Data Science community,” said current student Nathan Rickert. “The opportunity to connect with incoming students, share experiences, and engage in meaningful discussions showcased how this program fosters collaboration and mentorship.”

On Saturday, students boarded a shuttle to the University’s Hyde Park campus for a full day of learning and connection. The morning began with opening remarks from Aaron Dinner, Deputy Dean of the Physical Sciences Division, who welcomed students to campus and emphasized the importance of collaboration, innovation, and community within the data science field. His inspiring remarks set the tone for the day.

Following the welcome, students participated in a Capstone Roundtable Discussion, an interactive session where alumni and near-graduates rotated among tables to share insights from their Capstone Projects. From solving real-world business problems to navigating stakeholder expectations, the roundtable offered students a valuable look at how coursework translates into tangible impact.

Afterward, faculty members from the MS in Applied Data Science program took the stage for a “Meet Your Professors” segment. Each instructor introduced themselves, shared their areas of expertise, and gave students a glimpse into the academic experience that defines the program.

Other highlights from the day included:

* A Campus Tour and visit to the Data Science Institute: Students explored the historic campus, including taking a trip to the Data Science Institute
* Bookstore and Headshots: Students visited the UChicago bookstore, and took time to get professional headshots

“Immersion Weekend was a great experience!” shared current student Mohammad Khan. “After two quarters of classes on Zoom, it was energizing to connect in person with classmates and the faculty. Being able to build those relationships face-to-face made the program feel even more engaging and meaningful.”

Rounding out a day of connection, Associate Clinical Professor [Nick Kadochnikov](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/nick-kadochnikov/) led students through an interactive data science exercise using our very own City of Chicago data. Pouring over real Chicago data, students came up with their assessments, suggestions, and interpretations to present their teams’ findings to the room.

The shuttle ride back to NBC Tower was filled with chatter about marathons, LinkedIn contact sharing, and optimal heart rates for cognition exchanged by students, staff, and instructors alike.

Immersion Weekend is more than just a campus visit—it’s a chance to step into the UChicago experience, meet the people who shape the program, and forge lasting connections with peers from across the country. Spring 2025 Immersion Weekend students left with new skills and a deeper connection to their UChicago network.
