    Haruko Wainwright - Affiliate Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory & Assistant Professor, MIT

    **Professor Haruko Wainwright** is a highly respected Norman C. Rasmussen Career Development Professor and Assistant Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering, as well as Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT. Prof. Wainwright’s academic journey is distinguished, beginning with her BEng from Kyoto University, Japan, followed by an MS, an MA in Statistics, and a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. Before joining MIT in January 2022, she honed her expertise as a Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and an Adjunct Professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

    Prof. Wainwright’s research is concentrated on environmental modeling and monitoring technologies with a special emphasis on nuclear waste and nuclear-related contamination. She has been instrumental in the advancement of Bayesian methods for multi-type multiscale data and model-data integration. Her leadership is evident in several significant interdisciplinary projects, such as the US Department of Energy’s ALTEMIS project and the AI4ESP initiative. Through her innovative work in integrated environmental monitoring, nuclear waste disposal, and the development of environmental resilience in nuclear energy, Prof. Wainwright is actively shaping a safer and more sustainable future.

    Kohitij Kar - Assistant Professor & Canada Research Chair in Visual Neuroscience, York University

    **Dr. Kohitij Kar**, currently an Assistant Professor in Biology at York University, has established himself as a preeminent researcher in the field of Visual Neuroscience. With a strong academic foundation, including a B.Tech. from Heritage Institute of Technology in India, an M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Rutgers University, Dr. Kar has devoted his career to advancing our understanding of primate visual cognition. His Ph.D. research focused on exploring the neural mechanisms of transcranial electrical stimulation.

    After his doctorate, Dr. Kar expanded his research profile at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) McGovern Institute for Brain Research. First as a Postdoctoral Associate, then as a Research Scientist, he harnessed techniques like large-scale macaque electrophysiology and high throughput primate behavioral testing. Beyond his current position at York University, he holds multiple affiliations, such as the Canada Research Chair in Visual Neuroscience, Simons (SFARI) Investigator, and Visiting Scientist at MIT, reflecting his prominent standing in the field. Dr. Kar’s remarkable work continues to shape the future of visual neuroscience.
