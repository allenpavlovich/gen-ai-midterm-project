**Project: Queue Prediction for Supercomputers**

**Mentor/Lab:** [Ryan Chard](https://labs.globus.org/people.html)/[Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/people.html)

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning // Systems & Architecture

Research in many scientific domains require significant computational power resulting in limitations such as the expense to grab new resources and jobs being initiated only after a certain number of nodes become available. Therefore it is essential to incorporate intelligence in computing resource management. One of the key components of this intelligence is being able to predict queue wait times for jobs running through supercomputers using AWS and [Parsl](https://labs.globus.org/projects/parsl.html). In my project, I leveraged Amazon SageMaker, a cloud Machine Learning (ML) platform to create, train, and deploy a machine learning model to predict queue wait times.

This summer, I worked on [funcX](https://labs.globus.org/projects/funcx.html) web service, which is a serverless supercomputing project. It allows users to write, edit, delete, and execute functions over mobile devices with registered endpoints. I mainly worked on the user interface – the website – by writing codes to determine the design of webpages and ways of extracting data from the database with Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL codes.

I worked on a project aiming to help researchers calculate spatial access with a very simple interface. I made a website which allows users to easily calculate how easily people living in a certain location have access to a certain resource. This can be used to determine where there isn’t enough healthcare and other important goods.

***Project News:***The PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library) package in which this research project culminated is now [available](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#methods) online.
