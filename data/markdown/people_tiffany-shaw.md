# Tiffany Shaw

Professor, Geophysical Sciences; Faculty Director, AI for Climate

[Prof. Shaw](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~tas1/)’s research focuses on the physics of the atmosphere and climate system past, present and future. She seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms controlling the response to climate changes so that we can have greater confidence in future projections. Her approach combines theory (primarily conservation laws), numerical modeling across a hierarchy of complexity and observational data analysis. Prof. Shaw is excited to take advantage of AI/ML tools for increasing our understanding and prediction of the impacts of climate change. She is working to ensure these methods get the right answer for the right reasons.
