# Data science is becoming an increasingly visible topic in secondary education.

This website is for those who are considering bringing data science to their educational community and want to learn more.

## About the Pilot

In 2024, Outlier Research & Evaluation at the Data Science Institute at the University of Chicago conducted an implementation study of four high school data science curricula and the findings are reported here. The study was supported by the Valhalla Foundation and conducted in close collaboration with the Utah State Board of Education.

What is data science?

According to the [California Framework for Mathematics](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/):   
   
 Data science is an emerging discipline, and there is yet to be a consensus on exactly what content constitutes “data science.” Data science education organizations have conceptualized it as a cyclical process that includes problem formulation, data collection, data analysis, and interpretation and communication of findings (GAISE II, IDSSP, 2019). While the data science field continues to be shaped by emerging technologies and techniques deeply influenced by academia and business sectors, most definitions of data science recognize an intersection of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Data science may also include domain knowledge, ethics, and communication skills as well as specific approaches such as data mining (especially for data collected through the internet and electronic devices) and machine learning
