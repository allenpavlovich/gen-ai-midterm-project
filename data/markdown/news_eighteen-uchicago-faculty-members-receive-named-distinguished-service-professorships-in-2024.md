# Eighteen UChicago faculty members receive named, distinguished service professorships in 2024

Including DSI's very own Bo Li and Ce Zhang

Eighteen University of Chicago faculty members have received distinguished service professorships or named professorships.

Profs. Omri Ben-Shahar, Michael Bourdaghs, Veronica Guerrieri, Guido Lorenzoni, Harold Pollack and Mauricio Tenorio have been named distinguished service professors. Profs. Adam Chilton, Yoonsun Choi, Henry Hoffmann, Hakan Karateke, Greg Kaplan, Derek Kennet, Bo Li, Joseph Masco, James T. Robinson, Emily Rogalski, Christopher Wild and Ce Zhang have received named professorships.

The appointments were effective Jan. 1, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

#### Division of Biological Sciences

**Emily Rogalski** has been named the first Rosalind Franklin PhD Professor in the Department of Neurology. Rogalski joined UChicago in 2023 to lead the new University of Chicago Healthy Aging & Alzheimer’s Research Care (HAARC) Center, which will bring together a wide range of scientists and health experts to accelerate breakthroughs in aging, dementia and cognitive resilience.

Rogalski is a clinical and cognitive neuroscientist, and her research uses a highly multidisciplinary approach to investigate two aging perspectives: primary progressive aphasia, in which neurodegenerative disease invades the language network, and “SuperAging,” in which individuals are seemingly resistant to the deleterious changes in memory associated with “normal” or more typical cognitive aging.

Her aphasia research focuses on characterizing the clinical and anatomical features of primary progressive aphasia, drivers of disease progression, identifying risk factors, and refining our understanding of language and network organization. She has also pioneered a line of care support research for individuals with dementia including the development of Communication Bridge, an intervention delivered via telemedicine focused on maximizing communication and quality of life for individuals with the condition and their care partners.

She operationalized the SuperAging phenotype and has helped to establish the unique biologic, molecular, genetic and psychosocial features associated with SuperAging. She leads an international study of SuperAgers that holds promise for identifying protective factors for avoiding Alzheimer’s disease, optimizing health span and reducing stigma and negative expectations associated with aging.

She is the recipient of several awards, including Crain’s Chicago Business ‘40 under 40’ and the Alzheimer’s Association Howie Dean Award.

#### Division of the Humanities

**Michael K. Bourdaghs** has been named the Robert S. Ingersoll Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations and the College.

As a scholar of modern Japanese literature, literary and critical theory and music, Bourdaghs focuses on moving beyond the boundaries of Japan across multiple global networks for his research. He believes these dialogues fundamentally shape the meanings of the nation’s culture, literature and music. In his book “[A Fictional Commons: Natsume Sōseki and the Properties of Modern Literature](https://www.dukeupress.edu/a-fictional-commons)” (2021), recipient of an honorable mention for the 2023 John Whitney Hall Prize from the Association of Asian Studies, Bourdaghs re-examines the fiction and critical essays of Sōseki as they relate to ideologies of modern property ownership.

In the realm of Japanese popular music from 1945 to the early 1990s, in “[Sayonara Amerika, Sayonara Nippon: A Geopolitical Pre-History of J-Pop](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/sayonara-amerika-sayonara-nippon/9780231158756)” (2012) he analyzes how songs performed by Kasagi Shizuko, Sakamoto Kyū and the Yellow Magic Orchestra engaged creatively with the shifting historical context of Japan’s Cold War. His current research project, for which Bourdaghs received a 2019 Guggenheim Fellowship, reconsiders Japanese culture during the Cold War era. Bourdaghs seeks to look beyond U.S./Japan bilateral relations to consider how Japanese writers, filmmakers and musicians participated in multiple Cold War networks. These include the First World of capitalist liberal democracies, the Second World of the socialist bloc and the Third World of the decolonization movement.

**Hakan Karateke** has been named the Kanuni Süleyman Professor in Ottoman and Modern Turkish Studies in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and the College.

A cultural historian of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, Karateke often explores the realms where philology and literary history intersect in his research. In “The Ottoman World: A Cultural History Reader. 1450–1700” (2021), co-authored with Helga Anetshofer at UChicago, Karateke shares a wide range of voices from Ottoman society for teachers and students, spanning many individuals and providing insights into everyday life. The collection includes texts from ordinary people originally written in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Armenian, Greek, Hebrew, Italian and Persian languages. The book accelerates the move away from a state-centered approach to Ottoman history.

Currently, Karateke is working on a project called “Ottoman Turkish: The Cultural History of a Language,” in which he aims to narrate the history of the language by exploring and reconstructing the changing perceptions of the Turkish language over several centuries. Karatake is the editor for the “[Ottoman and Turkish Studies](https://www.academicstudiespress.com/search-results-grid/?series=ottoman-and-turkish-studies)” book series at Academic Studies Press and co-editor for “[The Ottoman Empire and its Heritage](https://brill.com/display/serial/OEH?language=en)” series at Brill Academic Publishers.

**Christopher J. Wild** has been named the Peter B. Ritzma Professor in the Department of Germanic Studies and the College.

His wide-ranging scholarship covers the intersection of literature, theater, history, philosophy and religion from the Reformation to the early 19th century in Germany and beyond. In his research, Wild considers the role and impact of religious thought and practice in processes and phenomena considered genuinely modern and secular. On the other hand, he analyzes the mediality and formal semantics of European and German theater from its start in ancient Greece through modernism.

In his first book, “[Theater der Keuschheit—Keuschheit des Theaters, Zu einer Geschichte der (Anti-)Theatralität von Gryphius bis Kleist](https://books.google.com/books/about/Theater_der_Keuschheit_Keuschheit_des_Th.html?id=-AVmAAAAMAAJ)” (2003), Wild’s research interests converged as he investigated how religious sentiment influenced the historical transformation of German theater from the Baroque to Classicism. His book “[Descartes’ Meditative Turn: Cartesian Thought on Spiritual Practice](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=37214),” to be published in March 2024 by Stanford University Press, explores why Descartes borrowed his title for his most important work from a religious genre and how his philosophical reasoning can be considered meditative. Currently, Wild is working on a book project examining how the reform of religious media launched by Martin Luther and others paved the way for modern media technologies and practices.

#### Division of the Physical Sciences

**Henry Hoffmann** has been named the Liew Family Chair and Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the College.

#### Division of the Social Sciences

**Greg Kaplan** has been named the Alvin H. Baum Professor in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics and the College.

Kaplan is a leading applied economist focusing primarily on macroeconomics and household behavior, whose findings have attracted significant attention in academic and policy circles. He has published extensively on the topics of monetary and fiscal policy, risk sharing, inequality, unemployment, household formation, migration and consumer spending.

Kaplan’s research has established the existence and importance of wealthy hand-to-mouth households in the United States. These households, accounting for about a quarter of total US households, own substantial illiquid assets but few liquid assets, resulting in consumption that closely tracks income despite high net worth. Since these wealthy hand-to-mouth households represent a significant share of aggregate consumption, they have major macroeconomic implications that Kaplan has explored in Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models.

**Joseph Masco** has been named the Samuel N. Harper Professor in the Department of Anthropology and the College.

An internationally recognized scholar operating in the intersections of science studies, anthropology and American culture, Masco’s contributions to our understanding of the imbrication of technoscientific revolution, existential risk and national security have unfolded across a trio of books: the award-winning “The Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Cold War New Mexico” (2006); “The Theater of Operations: National Security Affect from the Cold War to the War on Terror” (2014); and “The Future of Fallout, and Other Episodes in Radioactive Worldmaking” (2021).

Marked by a keenly sensitive attention to materiality, affect and psychosocial meaning, Masco’s work has brought international recognition. His latest publications include an edited volume with Deborah Thomas, “Sovereignty Unhinged: An Illustrated Primer for the Study of Present Intensities, Disavowals and Temporal Derangements” (2023), and a co-edited volume with Lisa Wedeen, “Conspiracy/Theory” (2024), which considers the stakes of epistemology in an age of disinformation and polarization. His work continues via a long-running project at the Neubauer Collegium on “Engineered Worlds,” a collaboration focused on planetary scale environmental emergency.

Masco’s work has been supported by the American Council of Learned Societies, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities and The Wenner-Gren Foundation. He has been a residential fellow at the School for Advanced Research, held a Benjamin Meaker Visiting Professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study (University of Bristol) and has been a member of the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton). In 2017, he was awarded a Faculty Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching and Mentoring at the University of Chicago.

**Mauricio Tenorio** has been named the Gustavus F. and Ann M. Swift Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of History and the College.

A prolific author of 15 books and well over 50 papers, many of them with top academic publishers and journals, Tenorio is recognized for his extraordinary range of expertise as well as his unparalleled originality as a thinker. His first book, “Mexico at the World’s Fairs: Crafting a Modern Nation” (1996), set the tone by opening with remarks about how “A Thousand and One Nights” might be seen as a model for historical narrative, given the “chaos” that the historian is presented with by actuality.

Tenorio’s succeeding works on the history of cities, languages, and conceptions of history—from “‘I Speak of the City’: Mexico City at the Turn of the Twentieth Century” (2013) to “Clio´s Laws: On History and Language” (2019), among others—have similarly shown a remarkable ability to link the whimsical to the profound, the psychological to the sociological, and the intimately particular to the universal.

#### Booth School of Business

**Veronica Guerrieri** has been named the Ronald E. Tarrson Distinguished Service Professor of Economics.

The Williard Graham Faculty Scholar at Chicago Booth, she is also a fellow of the Econometric Society, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a research fellow at the Center for Economic Policy Research, and the co-director of the Macro Initiative of the Becker Friedman Institute. Guerrieri was a managing editor of the Review of Economic Studies in 2017-2021. She is also a consultant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and in 2021 she has been a consultant for the Italian Prime Minister. Guerrieri’s work focuses on macroeconomics, labor and financial markets, business cycles, and growth.

She won the Bernácer Prize in 2015 for the best European economist under 40 in macroeconomics and finance, the Carlo Alberto medal in 2013 for the best Italian economist under 40, the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 2011, and the Excellence Award in Global Economic Affairs in 2010 from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

**Guido Lorenzoni** has been named the first Robert W. Fogel Distinguished Service Professor.

His fields of research are macroeconomics and international finance. His work has focused on various innovations in macro modeling motivated by current events. He has worked on building models with heterogeneous consumers to interpret the Great Recession and to study the effect of house price cycles on aggregate activity. He also worked on models of sovereign debt applied to the Euro crisis, and on multi-sector models applied to the effect of the Covid pandemic on the US economy and on the post-pandemic recovery. His most recent work focuses on interpreting recent inflation dynamics and on the connection between distributional conflict and the inflation experience.

Lorenzoni is also a research associate at the National Bureau for Economic Research and a consultant for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Before joining the UChicago faculty, he worked at Princeton, MIT and Northwestern. He received the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship and is an elected fellow of the Econometric Society.

**Yoonsun Choi** has been named the Mose J. and Sylvia Firestone Professor in the Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice and the College.

Choi is the director of the Doctoral Program at Crown and a fellow of the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare. She served as the Vice President of the Society for Social Work and Research and as the Chair of the Asian Caucus of the Society for Research on Child Development. Choi has led the Midwest Longitudinal Study of Asian American Families (MLSAAF), a longitudinal survey research following about 800 Filipino- and Korean-American families since 2014 to identify multiple developmental trajectories of young Asian Americans. Having started when the participants were adolescents who are now young adults, the study will follow them into their late twenties. Choi’s scholarship is particularly interested in the role of culture in family (such as culturally unique family processes and intergenerational cultural conflict), racial prejudice and discrimination, ethnic/racial identity, culture change and formation (acculturation), and the intersection of culture and socioeconomic class that may be unique issues for ethnic/racial and cultural minority and immigrant/migrant youth.

**Harold Pollack** has been named the Helen Ross Distinguished Service Professor in the Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice, the Department of Public Health Sciences, and the College.

Pollack’s research seeks to understand how to improve services and interventions for people who live with psychiatric or substance use disorders, and services for people who live with physical and intellectual disabilities. The faculty co-director of the University of Chicago Urban Health Lab, Pollack has authored 190 academic publications, and has served on four committees of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. A member of the UChicago faculty since 2003, he regularly advises local, state and federal officials concerning criminal justice, disability and public health policy.
