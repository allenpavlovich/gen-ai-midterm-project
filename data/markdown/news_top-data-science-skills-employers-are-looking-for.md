# Top Data Science Skills Employers Are Looking For

As data science capabilities continue to advance, so do the expectations for professionals entering or advancing in this space. Employers are looking for more than just technical skills—they want well-rounded data scientists who can make an impact. Here are top skills that employers are looking for and how the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) equips students with these capabilities.  

#### **Skill #1 Data Analysis**

At the core of any data science role is the ability to analyze data effectively. Employers look for professionals who can manage complex datasets, conduct in-depth analyses, and build models that deliver meaningful insights. [Shaddy Abado](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/shaddy-abado-phd-2/), Lead Data Scientist at Ulta and instructor for the MS in Applied Data Science program comments on his **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting** course: “In this course, students get the opportunity to explore time series analysis techniques for real-world applications and be introduced to the foundational concepts. At the end of the course, students present their final projects where they get to apply the learned methodologies to real-world times series applications of their choice.” 

#### **Skill #2 Data Storytelling**

Candidates who can create compelling data visualizations and explain findings in a way that resonates with stakeholders will stand out in the hiring process. MS in Applied Data Science courses such as **Data Visualization Techniques** and the **Data Science Capstone Project** are designed to equip students with the skills to transform complex data into compelling narratives through charts and graphs.  

Assistant Director of External Partnerships, Lauren Darga says, “To further prepare students for this critical skill, the culminating experience of the MS in Applied Data Science program is a [Capstone Project.](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/) During the two-term Capstone project, student teams bring their advanced data science skills to life by solving real-world challenges with an industry partner. At the end of the project, they present their findings in a way that transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights, showcasing their enhanced technical expertise and storytelling abilities.” 

#### **Skill #3 Machine Learning and AI**

Machine learning and AI are at the heart of predictive analytics, allowing organizations to automate processes, enhance decision-making, and derive strategic insights from data. The MS in Applied Data Science program at the University of Chicago prepares students for this crucial area through courses like  **Machine Learning I & II,** **Natural Language Processing, and Cognitive Computing,** and a new elective introduced this autumn quarter, **Generative AI Principles**. These courses cover essential topics, from building predictive models and analyzing text data to exploring neural networks for complex problem-solving. Graduates leave with a robust skill set in machine learning, ready to meet the growing demand for professionals who can develop, refine, and implement intelligent data solutions. 

#### **Skill #4 Industry Knowledge**

Employers highly value data scientists who bring industry-specific knowledge to their roles. The MS in Applied Data Science program understands this, offering a variety of elective courses that allow students to tailor their learning to specific industries. Taught by faculty who are industry experts, electives such as **Financial Analytics**, **Health Analytics**, and **Supply Chain Optimization** equip students with specialized skills and insights.

The program also supports students’ career journeys through the [**Career Seminar**](https://applieddatascience.psd.uchicago.edu/career-seminar-faqs/), a progressive four-quarter course designed to help you navigate the job market. From improving application materials and networking tactics to mastering technical interviews and negotiating job offers, this course ensures students are prepared to land a role that fits their goals and grows their career in data science.

#### **Your Future in Data Science Starts Here**

Graduates of the MS in Applied Data Science program at the University of Chicago are equipped with the technical skills, communication abilities, and industry-specific knowledge that today’s employers demand. With a curriculum that combines advanced data analysis, data storytelling, machine learning, and specialized electives taught by industry experts, students are prepared to make a meaningful impact from day one.
