# The University of Chicago Data Science Institute and Google Partner on Cutting-Edge AI and Security Research

The University of Chicago Data Science Institute (DSI) and Google are launching new research collaborations, in partnership with [UChicago Computer Science](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/), aimed at addressing critical challenges and opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI) with respect to security, privacy, and digital safety. This partnership brings together leading experts from both academia and industry to drive meaningful advancements that will enhance user protection, improve AI-driven technologies, and shape the future of responsible data science.

**Advancing AI Innovation and Digital Safety**

Through this collaboration, researchers from UChicago and Google will tackle pressing and high-impact research areas such as AI-generated content detection, privacy protection, and security applications of large language models (LLMs). The partnership underscores a shared commitment to developing cutting-edge solutions that promote responsible AI use and bolster security in an increasingly digital world.

“We’re excited to join forces with Google to tackle some of the most urgent challenges in AI and data science,” said [Mike Franklin](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/michael-j-franklin/), Faculty Co-Director of the Data Science Institute and Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor.  “With our faculty’s unmatched expertise and passion, this partnership will push the boundaries of innovation, advancing AI applications in ways that drive real-world impact.”

The Data Science Institute and Google aim to make significant strides in digital safety, security, and AI transparency through these new research projects.

“This partnership with the UChicago Data Science team allows us to expand our research on some of today’s most critical topics, paving the way for further innovation and support for our users’” said [Royal Hansen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/royal-hansen-989858/), Vice President of Engineering at Google.

**Shaping the Future of AI and Security**

This partnership represents a critical step toward building responsible AI systems, enhancing online safety, and developing AI tools that better serve and protect users. With the combined expertise of Google’s industry-leading research scientists and UChicago’s pioneering researchers, this collaboration is poised to generate breakthroughs that will shape the future of AI and security research.

**Faculty and Research Focus Areas**

The collaboration will be led by a distinguished group of UChicago faculty representing Data Science and Computer Science who bring expertise across AI, cybersecurity, and digital safety:

* **[Marshini Chetty](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/marshini-chetty/)**, Associate Professor of Computer Science, will explore digital safety help-seeking behaviors, focusing particularly on how teens perceive and manage their digital privacy and security.
* **[Nick Feamster](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/nick-feamster/)**, Faculty Director of Tech Policy at the DSI and Neubauer Professor of Computer Science, will work alongside Marshini Chetty and Chenhao Tan, Associate Professor of Computer Science and Data Science, to develop new approaches to content moderation and the detection of AI-generated content. Professor Feamster will also work on a project to investigate the privacy implications of LLM plugins.
* **[Grant Ho](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/grant-ho/)**, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, will collaborate with Google to examine novel applications of LLMs for cybersecurity, including their use in detecting attacks or anomalies in audit logs.
* **[Blase Ur](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/blase-ur/)**, Associate Professor of Computer Science, will lead a project on LLM-based AI safety agents to help at-risk users navigate digital safety threats.

The University of Chicago and Google look forward to this partnership and the significant impacts this research will have on the field of AI and security.
