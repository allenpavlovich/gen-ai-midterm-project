These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n  Core\n\n  * [Leadership and Consulting for Data Science Letter Grade](#accordion-tab-0)\n\n    Professional organizations see value in data science when it helps them to achieve their strategic goals, and the current job market likewise rewards data scientists who can use data to advance organizational interests, either as an external consultant or within internal operations teams. Data scientists can become successful (and highly marketable) leaders in today\u2019s professional world, but they require an uncommon skill set: the strategic awareness to align data requirements with business requirements, the technical proficiency to choose a methodology appropriate to each new problem, and the communication skills to both execute the plan as part of a broader team and persuade others of their findings.\n\n  Core (Choose 1)\n\n  * [Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing Letter Grade](#accordion-tab-0)\n\n    Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering\u2014an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market.\u00a0Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications.
