Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) developed this framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has dominated statistics and data science for nearly two centuries. New methods based on non-Gaussian probability distributions emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century, enabling analysis of variables across broader domains and distributions. Additionally, new methods for analyzing general associations, distinct from Pearson correlation, were developed.",

The course bridges the gap between machine learning experiments and enterprise deployment. It covers three pillars: software engineering (architecture, CI/CD, data versioning), model engineering (AutoML, A/B testing), and deployment engineering (docker containers, model monitoring). The course focuses on industry best practices for deploying machine learning projects. Students gain exposure to MLOps platforms such as allegro, xpresso, Dataiku, LityxIQ, DataRobot, AWS Sagemaker, and technologies like gitHub, Jenkins, slack, docker, and kubernetes.",
