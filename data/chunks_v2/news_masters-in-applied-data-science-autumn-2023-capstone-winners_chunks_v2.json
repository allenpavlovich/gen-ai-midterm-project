At the Autumn Showcase—one of the program’s largest—projects covered diverse industries, data types, and methodologies. Seven teams received special recognition.\n\n“The hard work, perseverance, and talent is clear from the truly impressive quality of the work,” said [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/), executive director for the program. “I was especially pleased to see how inventive the teams were in the solutions they developed for their industry partners.”\n\nLearn more about the Best in Show projects below.",
