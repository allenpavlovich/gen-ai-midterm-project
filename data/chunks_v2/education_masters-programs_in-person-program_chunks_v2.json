Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752–1833) developed this framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has dominated statistics and data science for nearly two centuries. New methods based on non-Gaussian probability distributions emerged only in the latter half of the twentieth century, enabling analysis of variables across broader domains and distributions. Additionally, new methods for analyzing general associations, distinct from Pearson correlation, were developed.",
