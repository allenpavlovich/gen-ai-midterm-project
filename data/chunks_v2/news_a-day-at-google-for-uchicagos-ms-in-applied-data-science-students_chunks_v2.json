This trip rewarded their completion of the Career Course, a class designed to prepare students for the job market.\n\nThe day began with a fun icebreaker—students introduced themselves and shared their favorite Google product. The range was impressive, from everyday tools like Google Calendar to advanced data science solutions such as the recently launched large language model Gemini. Students then gained an insider’s perspective through presentations from seven Googlers, each describing their typical workday.\n\nA highlight for many was access to [Google Labs](https://labs.google), a digital playground for experimenting with the latest AI tools and testing hypotheses. Students explored projects like Generative AI with Vertex AI and Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Vertex AI Gemini API.\n\nTo conclude the visit, students toured the Google office, featuring well-stocked snack rooms, an arcade for work breaks, and a unique workspace—an old CTA train car on the rooftop, equipped with Wi-Fi.",

Jean-Sebastien Gaultier, a current student in the program, said: “The invitation to Google was a great surprise! Meeting professionals in different sectors of Google Cloud gave me a great idea of the inner workings of Google. The amazing office spaces further enhanced the experience. Working in a 10-story building dedicated to collaboration is inspiring – who wouldn’t want to work at Google after seeing the office?”\n\nAnother student, Pamela Gonzalez Muniz, found the Google AM/ML Solutions presentation especially captivating. “Learning that so many of today’s leading AI technologies originated at Google was fascinating.” She added that gaining insights into future trends and tools was invaluable. What surprised Gonzalez Muniz most was the well-rounded nature of Google’s employee roles. She noted that all the presenters possessed strong technical skills, business acumen, and excellent interpersonal abilities.",
