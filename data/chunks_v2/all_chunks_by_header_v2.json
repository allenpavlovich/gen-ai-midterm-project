Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) developed this framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has dominated statistics and data science for nearly two centuries. New methods based on non-Gaussian probability distributions emerged only in the latter half of the twentieth century, enabling analysis of variables across broader domains and distributions. Additionally, new methods for analyzing general associations, distinct from Pearson correlation, were developed.",

Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) developed this framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has dominated statistics and data science for nearly two centuries. New methods based on non-Gaussian probability distributions emerged only in the latter half of the twentieth century, enabling analysis of variables across broader domains and distributions. Additionally, new methods for analyzing general associations, distinct from Pearson correlation, were developed.",

At the recent Summer Showcase, students presented a diverse range of innovative projects. Six teams were recognized for their outstanding work.\n\nGreg Green, Senior Instructional Professor and Director of the MS in Applied Data Science program, reflected on the Capstone Showcase: “The advanced AI and Data Science Capstone projects completed this summer spanned many technical areas including NLP, Computer Vision/Deep Learning, Advanced Machine Learning, and Large Language Models just recently made available. We continue to be impressed not only with the advanced thinking within the technical solutions but the clarity of communication and presentation styles that make these solutions understandable to senior business leaders from a variety of domains of expertise.”\n\nPeerapak Adsavakulchai, one of the Summer Capstone winners, noted that his team’s strength was their diverse backgrounds, with members from trading, consulting, and data science-driven research. This diversity brought unique perspectives and skills to the project.\n\nLearn more about the projects that won Best in Show below.",

FTI and other consulting companies operate on a project-to-project basis, making it difficult to maintain traditional, efficient databases like those used by transactional businesses. Much of the data exists in “inefficient” file types. FTI Chat, a chatbot leveraging LLMs, automates project approach creation based on client needs. It retrieves past project data using RAG and generates responses via an open-source LLM. Due to its ease of use, FTI Chat has the potential to become a staple product deployed independently, enabling different teams to streamline their business development processes.",

To understand the shared attributes of these two business categories and those that met the award goals, this study analyzes 2023 federal contract awards using autoencoding models for dimensionality reduction and t-SNE for visualization to identify clusters. The team’s findings provide insights into which agencies and contract types were awarded to various small business categories.",

Originally from Eastern Europe and having lived in several countries, Mrozowski returned from Australia in late 2013 to start the next phase of his career in the United States. His first job offer with GE presented a unique opportunity. “I got three job offers, and all of them paid similar amounts of money, but GE told me that they pay 100% tuition at the school of my choice. So I was like, okay, and I joined GE and the University of Chicago at the same time,” he recalls, describing his entry into the newly launched program.",

He established the Data Science function at Woolworths, Australia’s largest retailer, before the term “Data Science” was widely used, serving as Business Support Manager. Later, at GE, he led marketing analytics for the Sam’s Club credit card portfolio, further expanding his hands-on expertise. Although well-versed in analytics, the program helped him refine skills in areas such as data engineering and cloud computing. “That helped me a lot in my career since I joined the program,” he says. “It definitely improved some of my skills, especially in the area of data engineering and cloud computing.”",

    "page_content": "#### **The Accidental Teacher: From Student to Professor**\n\nMrozowski’s move into teaching was as unplanned as his entry into the program. While working with fellow students on an assignment, a group member—who also taught at another university—recognized his expertise and encouraged him to consider teaching. This led to his first teaching role at Benedictine University in Naperville while he was still a student. His passion for teaching grew from there. “When I was talking to professors at UChicago, they were like, ‘Why don’t you TA?’ So I thought, why not?” he shares.\n\nThis early teaching experience inspired him to pursue a PhD in economics in Poland, sponsored by the National Bank of his home country. Upon returning to Chicago, Mrozowski enrolled in a consulting class taught by [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/) and [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/), who were part of the new program leadership. He valued the insights and perspectives they brought, noting how the curriculum continued to evolve. Since then, Mrozowski has served as a TA for multiple UChicago [Applied Data Science courses](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/), including *Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics*, *Big Data and Cloud Computing*, and *Time Series Analysis and Forecasting*, among others. Reflecting on his experiences, he muses, “If I didn’t go to Europe, maybe I would be teaching by now as well.”",

He sees it as a crucial foundation for success in the field. Whenever possible, he hires interns and employees from the program, recognizing their strong foundational skills and readiness for real-world challenges.",

Whether troubleshooting code or guiding students through difficult concepts, he takes pride in enabling their success. “You wouldn’t believe how much time I sometimes spend with data engineering students when there is a little-known issue,” he says.

This trip rewarded their completion of the Career Course, a class designed to prepare students for the job market.\n\nThe day began with a fun icebreaker—students introduced themselves and shared their favorite Google product. The range was impressive, from everyday tools like Google Calendar to advanced data science solutions such as the recently launched large language model Gemini. Students then gained an insider’s perspective through presentations from seven Googlers, each describing their typical workday.\n\nA highlight for many was access to [Google Labs](https://labs.google), a digital playground for experimenting with the latest AI tools and testing hypotheses. Students explored projects like Generative AI with Vertex AI and Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Vertex AI Gemini API.\n\nTo conclude the visit, students toured the Google office, featuring well-stocked snack rooms, an arcade for work breaks, and a unique workspace—an old CTA train car on the rooftop, equipped with Wi-Fi.",

Jean-Sebastien Gaultier, a current student in the program, said: “The invitation to Google was a great surprise! Meeting professionals in different sectors of Google Cloud gave me a great idea of the inner workings of Google. The amazing office spaces further enhanced the experience. Working in a 10-story building dedicated to collaboration is inspiring – who wouldn’t want to work at Google after seeing the office?”\n\nAnother student, Pamela Gonzalez Muniz, found the Google AM/ML Solutions presentation especially captivating. “Learning that so many of today’s leading AI technologies originated at Google was fascinating.” She added that gaining insights into future trends and tools was invaluable. What surprised Gonzalez Muniz most was the well-rounded nature of Google’s employee roles. She noted that all the presenters possessed strong technical skills, business acumen, and excellent interpersonal abilities.",
