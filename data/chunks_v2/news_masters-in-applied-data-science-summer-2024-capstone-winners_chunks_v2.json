At the recent Summer Showcase, students presented a diverse range of innovative projects. Six teams were recognized for their outstanding work.\n\nGreg Green, Senior Instructional Professor and Director of the MS in Applied Data Science program, reflected on the Capstone Showcase: “The advanced AI and Data Science Capstone projects completed this summer spanned many technical areas including NLP, Computer Vision/Deep Learning, Advanced Machine Learning, and Large Language Models just recently made available. We continue to be impressed not only with the advanced thinking within the technical solutions but the clarity of communication and presentation styles that make these solutions understandable to senior business leaders from a variety of domains of expertise.”\n\nPeerapak Adsavakulchai, one of the Summer Capstone winners, noted that his team’s strength was their diverse backgrounds, with members from trading, consulting, and data science-driven research. This diversity brought unique perspectives and skills to the project.\n\nLearn more about the projects that won Best in Show below.",

FTI and other consulting companies operate on a project-to-project basis, making it difficult to maintain traditional, efficient databases like those used by transactional businesses. Much of the data exists in “inefficient” file types. FTI Chat, a chatbot leveraging LLMs, automates project approach creation based on client needs. It retrieves past project data using RAG and generates responses via an open-source LLM. Due to its ease of use, FTI Chat has the potential to become a staple product deployed independently, enabling different teams to streamline their business development processes.",

To understand the shared attributes of these two business categories and those that met the award goals, this study analyzes 2023 federal contract awards using autoencoding models for dimensionality reduction and t-SNE for visualization to identify clusters. The team’s findings provide insights into which agencies and contract types were awarded to various small business categories.",
