**Talk Title:** Targeting humanitarian aid with machine learning and digital data

**Abstract:**The vast majority of humanitarian aid and social protection programs globally are targeted, providing assistance to individuals or communities identified to be poorest or most in need. In low and middle-income countries, the targeting of aid programs is often limited by low-quality, out-of-date, or missing data on poverty and vulnerability. Novel “big” digital data sources, such as those captured by satellites, mobile phones, and financial services providers — when combined with advances in machine learning — can improve the accuracy of aid program targeting. In this talk, I will cover empirical results on the accuracy of these new data-driven and algorithmic approaches to aid allocation, and will discuss emergent implications for fairness, privacy, transparency, and community dynamics.

**Talk Title:** Algorithmic Foundations of Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning and Multi-agent Systems

**Abstract:**Policy optimization methods have been integral to the empirical success of comtemporary reinforcement learning (RL). A recent flurry of works endeavored to developing policy optimization methods with provable convergence guarantee. Our works contribute to this recent line of research by investigating non-asymptotic convergence guarantee and improving the dependencies on salient problem parameters.

We start with policy optimization for tabular single-agent RL, where the intrinsic non-concavity poses a significant challenge to obtaining convergence guarantee. By combining natural policy gradient (NPG) methods with entropy regularization, we deliver the first provably linearly converging policy optimization method to the global optimal policy at a dimension-free rate, assuming access to exact policy evaluation. Going beyond entropy regularization, we design a novel policy optimization method that accommodates various choices of regularizers by leveraging Bregman divergence and mirror descent and provably works even when the regularizer lacks strong convexity and smoothness.

In the presence of multiple agents, the goal of policy optimization is to find an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE), preferably through an independent learning process. Noticeably, existing analyses on learning NE for competitive games fall short of characterizing the last-iterate of the learning algorithm in a dimension-free manner. We make progress by designing novel extragradient policy optimization methods that converge to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) of competitive games at a dimension-free linear rate, enabling learning approximate NE without introducing additional assumptions typically needed in prior results. We further extend our algorithms and the accompanying analysis to competitive Markov games and multi-player zero-sum polymatrix games.

**Talk Title:**Inferring networks and behaviors from novel data for critical decision-making

**Abstract:** In an interconnected and fast-moving world, effective policymaking increasingly relies on understanding complex human networks and dynamic behaviors. Novel, high-frequency data sources, such as cell phones and search engines, introduce new opportunities to capture these networks and behaviors at scale. However, there remain substantial gaps between real-world systems and what is recorded in data, such as incomplete networks, unlabeled data, and unknown causal mechanisms. My research seeks to close these gaps by developing methods in data science and machine learning to infer robust signals about real-world networks and behaviors from novel data sources. Using these methods, I derive behavioral insights and build policy tools for high-stakes societal challenges, from pandemic response to political polarization to supply chain disruptions.

In this talk, I will focus on my research related to pandemic response. Specifically, I will cover two lines of work: (1) inferring fine-grained mobility networks from aggregated location data and modeling the spread of COVID- 19, (2) developing machine learning systems to accurately detect vaccine seeking and discover the concerns of vaccine holdouts from anonymized search logs. The findings from these works informed public health policies for reopening, reducing disparities, and distributing vaccines. More broadly, these works demonstrate the potential for large-scale data and computation to aid policymakers, paving a new way to support critical decision-making across domains.

**Bio:** Marie is a PhD candidate at MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, conducting research at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems and the Broad Institute. Her research combines statistical machine learning, causal inference, and network science, with applications in medicine and public health.

In particular, she builds disease-specific hypergraphs to formulate drug repurposing hypotheses and utilizes the target trial emulation framework to evaluate repurposing candidates for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias using structured (e.g., diagnosis codes) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes) from electronic health records, across multiple medical centers. Methodologically, her work involves the use of doubly-robust machine learning and causal matrix estimation and the development of synthetic control and instrumental variable approaches adapted to survival analysis. With a focus on aging populations, she also designs comprehensive agent-based models that integrate granular sociodemographic and mobility data to optimize the distribution of vaccines against infectious diseases at the state and national level and inform public policy decision-making.

Previously, Marie obtained a BSc in Engineering Sciences from Ecole Centrale Paris in France and a MSc in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University. As a data scientist at Microsoft, she analyzed the effects of technology usage and digital collaboration on student academic outcomes and socio-emotional learnings in school networks with treatment spillovers. She interned at Goldman Sachs, Microsoft Research, the European Commission, INSERM-INRIA in France, and Clalit Innovation in Israel.

**Talk Title:** Antihypertensive drug repurposing for dementia prevention: target trial emulations in two large-scale electronic health record systems

**Abstract:** Alzheimer’s disease (AD)—the most common type of dementia—affects 5.7 million people in the US and costs about $250 billion annually. Since there are no disease-modifying therapies to date, repurposing FDA-approved drugs preventing dementia onset offers an expedited path to reduce the impact of this epidemic. Beyond age, type 2 diabetes and hypertension are two major risk factors for dementia onset. However, mixed results are emerging from prior observational studies contrasting various antihypertensive drug classes, including Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), and Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB).

To address this complexity and evaluate the repurposing potential of antihypertensives with different mechanisms of action, we deployed a causal inference approach accounting for the competing risk of death in emulated clinical trials using two distinct electronic health record (EHR) systems, one from the UK Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) and the other from the US Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR). We performed intention-to-treat analyses among patients aged 50 or older at baseline, applying Inverse Propensity score of Treatment Weighting to balance the two treatment arms with respect to a set of confounders curated by cardiologists and neurologists. Specifically, we compared antihypertensive treatment initiation with any of seven ARBs vs any of eleven ACE inhibitors.

In the US RPDR database, a total of 45,206 patients were eligible to participate in the emulated target trial. Treatment initiation with any of the seven ARBs was associated with lower hazard of all-cause mortality (HR=1.16 [95% CI: 1.10-1.23]) and lower cause-specific hazard of dementia onset (HR=1.34 [95% CI: 1.27-1.42]) in cause-specific Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) models, after accounting for prolonged survival, relative to treatment initiation with any of the eleven ACE inhibitors. In addition, within the ARB drug class, the gap in the dementia risk difference over time was more pronounced among patients initiating on compounds that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Results of the competing risks analysis were robust to the structure of the outcome models (i.e., Cox PH vs nonparametric). The directionality and strength of our findings were similar in the UK CPRD database.

Target trial emulations in two large-scale EHR systems suggest that treatment initiation with BBB-crossing ARBs might reduce the risk of dementia among hypertensive patients. Ongoing work includes the conduct of a mediation analysis in the two considered cohorts to assess the role played by enhanced blood pressure control towards dementia prevention.

**Talk Title:**A Nonstochastic Control Approach to Optimization

**Abstract:** In the modern deep learning pipeline, selecting the best optimization algorithm and the associated set of hyperparameters for a particular problem instance is crucial. The choice of the optimizer can significantly influence the performance of the trained model. However, this is a nonconvex task, and a result, iterative optimization methods such as hypergradient descent lack global optimality guarantees in general.

We propose an online nonstochastic control methodology for mathematical optimization. First, we formalize the setting of meta-optimization, an online learning formulation of learning the best optimization algorithm from a class of methods. The meta-optimization problem over gradient-based methods can be framed as a feedback control problem over the choice of hyperparameters, including the learning rate, momentum, and the preconditioner.

Although the original optimal control problem is nonconvex, we show how recent methods from online nonstochastic control using convex relaxations can be used to overcome the challenge of nonconvexity, and obtain regret guarantees against the best offline solution. This guarantees that in meta-optimization, given a sequence of optimization problems, we can learn a method that attains convergence comparable to that of the best optimization method in hindsight from a class of methods. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that our meta-optimization algorithm can continuously improve given problem instances, and become competitive with the best tuned method among a class of methods.

**Talk Title:**Flat minima generalize for low-rank matrix recovery

**Abstract:**Empirical evidence suggests that for a variety of overparameterized nonlinear models, most notably in neural network training, the growth of the loss around a minimizer strongly impacts its performance. Flat minima — those around which the loss grows slowly — appear to generalize well. This work takes a step towards understanding this phenomenon by focusing on the simplest class of overparameterized nonlinear models: those arising in low-rank matrix recovery. We analyze overparameterized matrix and bilinear sensing, robust PCA, covariance matrix estimation, and single hidden layer neural networks with quadratic activation functions. In all cases, we show that flat minima, measured by the trace of the Hessian, exactly recover the ground truth under standard statistical assumptions.

**Bio:**Dongqi Fu is a final-year Ph.D. Candidate majoring in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is interested on developing data mining and machine learning algorithms on graph data (i.e., non-IID, relational, non-grid, non-Euclidean data). Moreover, the real-world graph data can be (1) related to the temporal information (i.e., time-evolving topological structures, time-evolving node/graph features/labels, etc.) and (2) imperfect (i.e., missing features, scarce labels, hard-to-interpret, redundant, privacy-leaking, robustness-lacking, etc.). Hence, his research focuses on investigating (1) Natural Dynamics (e.g., leveraging spatial-temporal properties of graphs) and (2) Artificial Dynamics (e.g., augmenting and pruning graph components) in Graph Mining, Graph Representations, and Graph Neural Networks to achieve task performance upgrades in accuracy, efficiency, explanation, privacy, fairness, etc., and he is also keen on Graph Data Management and Graph Theory. He used to be a research scientist intern at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and Meta AI for graph research and applications.

**Talk Title:**Towards Powerful Graph Learning via Natural and Artificial Dynamics

**Abstract:**In the era of big data, the relationship between entities has become much more complex than ever before. As a kind of relational data structure, graphs (or networks) attract much research attention for dealing with this  
unprecedented phenomenon.

In the long run, graph learning methods face two general challenges when adapting to the complexities of the real world. Firstly, the graph structure and features may change over time (i.e., time-evolving topological structures, time-evolving node/graph features/labels, etc.). The resulting problems include but are not limited to ignoring entity temporal correlation, overlooking causality discovery, computation inefficiency, non-  
generalization, etc. Secondly, the initial topological structure and node or graph features may be imperfect (e.g., having construction errors, sampling noises, missing features, scarce labels, hard-to-interpret, redundant, privacy-leaking, robustness-lacking, etc.). The corresponding problems include but are not limited to non- robustness, indiscriminative representations, non-generalization, etc.

Hence, this research talk will concentrate on investigating how to study (1) Natural Dynamics (e.g., leveraging spatial-temporal properties of graphs) and (2) Artificial Dynamics (e.g., augmenting and pruning graph components) for Graph Mining, Graph Representations, and Graph Neural Networks to achieve task performance upgrades in accuracy, efficiency, trustworthiness, etc.

**Talk Title:**The Measure and Mismeasure of Fairness

**Abstract:** The field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last decade, several formal, mathematical definitions of fairness have gained prominence. Here we first  
assemble and categorize these definitions into two broad families: (1) those that constrain the effects of decisions on disparities; and (2) those that constrain the effects of legally protected characteristics, like race and gender, on decisions. We then show, analytically and empirically, that both families of definitions typically result in strongly Pareto dominated decision policies. For example, in the case of college admissions, adhering to popular formal conceptions of fairness would simultaneously result in lower student-body diversity and a less academically prepared class, relative to what one could achieve by explicitly tailoring admissions policies to achieve desired outcomes. In this sense, requiring that these fairness definitions hold can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect. In contrast to axiomatic notions of fairness, we argue that the equitable design of algorithms requires grappling with their context-specific consequences, akin to the equitable design of policy. We conclude by listing several open challenges in fair machine learning and offering strategies to ensure algorithms are better aligned with policy goals.

**Talk Title:**Computational Approaches for Studying Dietary Behaviors with Digital Traces

**Abstract:**Human dietary habits shape our health, daily life, societies, the environment, and life on earth. However, it remains challenging to understand and attempt to change dietary behaviors using traditional methods due to  
measurement and causal identification challenges.

In this talk, I will describe computational and causal approaches leveraging large-scale passively sensed digital traces to shed new light on our dietary behaviors and derive novel scientific insights. I study dietary behaviors in two contexts: campus-wide and worldwide, based on digital traces capturing behaviors of tens of thousands of people on campus and millions of internet users.

First, I will present studies based on situated on-campus food purchase logs. The first study reveals how, when a person acquires a new eating partner on campus or has a meal together, the healthiness of their food choice shifts significantly in the direction of their new eating partner’s dietary patterns. Second, I will describe a study leveraging online information-seeking traces (Google search query logs). Studying worldwide dietary behaviors, I identify and describe global shifts in dietary interests during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, I critically investigate the limits to how much computational approaches can reveal about dietary behaviors in the general population. I outline a framework for reasoning about biases of digital traces and present a case study of food consumption in Switzerland.

Overall, these novel scientific findings and methodological advances contribute to the existing knowledge about human dietary behaviors and inform the design of food systems, policies, and interventions.

**Talk Title:**Exploring and Learning in Sparse Linear MDPs without Computationally Intractable Oracles

**Abstract:**The key assumption underlying linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is that the learner has access to a known feature map from state-action pairs to d-dimensional vectors, and that the rewards and transitions are linear functions in this representation. But where do these features come from? In the absence of expert domain knowledge, a tempting strategy is to use the “kitchen sink” approach and hope that the true features are included in a much larger set of potential features. In this work we revisit linear MDPs from the perspective of feature selection. In a k-sparse linear MDP, there is an unknown subset of size k containing all the relevant features, and the goal is to learn a near-optimal policy in only poly(k, log d) interactions with the environment. Our main result is the first polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. In contrast, earlier works either made prohibitively strong assumptions that obviated the need for exploration, or required solving computationally intractable optimization problems.

As a corollary of our main result, we give an algorithm for learning a near-optimal policy in block MDPs whose decoding function is a low-depth decision tree; the algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time and takes a polynomial number of samples. This can be seen as a reinforcement learning analogue of classic results in computational learning theory. Furthermore, it gives a natural model where improving the sample complexity via representation learning is computationally feasible.

Prior to Stanford, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Tsinghua University. My research aims at developing modern statistical methods for trusted inference and decision-making, that are simple, robust, generalizable, and minimal in assumptions.

In addition, I study how to generalize causal inference to new contexts and new decision rules; my work under this theme concerns methodological and empirical foundations for the replicability, robustness, and transportability of causal effects, as well as algorithms and theories for policy learning with offline data from sequential experiments.

**Talk Title:**Model-free selective inference with conformal p-values and its application in drug discovery

**Abstract:**In decision-making or scientific discovery pipelines such as job hiring and drug discovery, before any resource-intensive step, there is often an initial screening step that uses predictions from a machine learning model to shortlist a few candidates from a large pool. We introduce a framework that allows using any prediction model to select candidates whose unobserved outcomes exceed user-specified values, while rigorously controlling the false positives. Given a set of calibration data that are exchangeable with the test sample, we leverage conformal inference ideas to construct p-values that allow us to shortlist candidates with exact false discovery rate (FDR) control. In addition, I will discuss new ideas to further deal with covariate shifts between calibration and test samples, a scenario that occurs in almost all such problems including drug discovery, hiring, causal inference, and healthcare. Our methods are flexible wrappers around any complex model. In practical drug discovery tasks, our methods greatly narrow the set of promising drug candidates to manageable sizes while maintaining rigorous FDR control.

**Talk Title:** Socially responsible NLP via causal and moral principles

**Abstract:**We are currently navigating through an era marked by numerous social challenges: the COVID pandemic, climate change, as well as escalating concerns on the safety of large language models (LLMs). With all these concerning challenges, I establish my research on socially responsible NLP using causal and moral principles. Specifically, I use causal inference to benchmark existing LLMs’ reasoning ability, analyze the failure modes of LLMs, and interpret the relation between data collection and model learning. Further, I combine interdisciplinary knowledge from moral philosophy to design socially-important moral questions to test LLMs, and propose standards for future models to be more morally safe.

**Talk Title:**ARUBA: Efficient and Adaptive Meta-learning with Provable Guarantees

**Abstract:**Meta-learning has recently emerged as an important direction for multi-task learning, dynamic environments, and federated settings. We present a theoretical framework for designing practical meta-learning methods that integrates natural formalizations of task-similarity with the extensive literature on online convex optimization and sequential prediction algorithms. Our approach, which works by learning surrogate losses bounding the within-task regret of base learning algorithms, enables the task-similarity to be learned adaptively and leads to straightforward derivations of average-case regret bounds that improve if the tasks are similar. We highlight how our theory can be extended to numerous settings, especially for deriving multi-task guarantees for bandit algorithms.

**Talk Title:** Sentence-level Media Bias Analysis through Content Structures Modeling

**Abstract:** News media plays a vast role not only by providing information, but also by selecting, packaging, and organizing the information to shape public opinions. Media outlets are becoming more partisan and polarized nowadays, and developing sophisticated models to detect media bias becomes necessary. Most prior work in the NLP community focused on detecting media bias either at the source level or the article level. However, articles consist of multiple sentences, and each sentence serves different purposes in narrating a news story. We aim to identify media bias at a more fine-grained sentence level, and pinpoint bias sentences that seek to implant ideological bias and manipulate public opinions. Sentence-level media bias can be very subtle and tends to be presented in a neutral and factual tone. Our research demonstrates that modeling the content structures of news articles can reveal such implicit ideological bias.

**Talk Title:**Decoding Real-World Evidence: Bridging GAMs and LLMs to Expose “Death by Round Numbers”

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing natural language processing, but combining their implicit knowledge with explicit statistical machine learning models is an ongoing challenge. To bridge these systems, we propose to use generalized additive models (GAMs). GAMs decompose complex outcomes into separable component functions, creating a modular structure that fits seamlessly into LLM context windows. As a result, GAMs can unleash the power of LLMs for traditional machine learning tasks.

We demonstrate an exciting application of this perspective: automated surprise finding. Real-world data science grapples with complications like hidden confounding, often necessitating manual model inspections by domain experts. For instance, treatment-based confounding in medical data may inadvertently teach data- driven systems to perpetuate inherent biases. However, by bridging GAMs with LLMs, we harness the vast knowledge reservoir within LLMs to auto-detect anomalies that appear to contradict domain expertise.

This approach not only improves machine learning models, but also reveals quirks of the underlying system. Using this combination of glass-box GAMs and foundational LLMs, we evaluate four datasets of real-world medical evidence, identifying two characteristic types of medical biases: (1) discontinuous risk at sharp treatment thresholds and (2) counter-causal paradoxes where aggressive treatment reduces perceived risk.

Finally, we present the TalkToEBM package to establish this bridge between GAMs and LLMs and offer a lens to automatically identify surprising effects in statistical models.

**Talk Title:**Measuring Language By Social Groups in Natural Language Processing

**Abstract:**Language data embeds social identities, behaviors, and beliefs. That is, who we are is expressed through how we communicate. My research leverages natural language processing (NLP) methods to measure large-scale language patterns across social groups, and uses these measurements to answer sociolinguistic questions and inform model development. First, I’ll present studies quantifying community-specific words and meanings across two domains: online discussion forums and scholarly literature. In these studies, I leverage perspectives from sociolinguistics to relate communities’ use of distinctive language to various social factors, such as member loyalty, activity, network density, audience, and cross-community impact. Second, I’ll present an ongoing study analyzing the effects of large language model (LLM) pretraining data practices on text spanning a range of socioeconomic and geographic origins. Model developers often implement filters to extract “high-quality” data to train models. I’ll show whether notions of “quality” vary across popular LLMs’ filtering strategies, and what kinds of webtext are disproportionately removed during these curation processes. Finally, I will conclude by discussing challenges and questions raised by my research that point towards future directions for computational social science and NLP.

**Talk Title:**Foundations of Multisensory Artificial Intelligence

**Abstract:**The study of multisensory intelligence aims to understand the computational principles of multisensory integration and design practical AI systems that can similarly learn from multiple sensory inputs such as text, speech, audio, video, real-world sensors, wearable devices, and medical data. These multisensory AI systems can support human physical, emotional, and social well-being, enable multimedia content processing, and enhance real-world autonomous agents, which hold great promise for impact in many scientific areas with practical benefits.

Multisensory intelligence brings unique challenges to machine learning given the heterogeneity and interactions often found between modalities. In this talk, I will discuss my recent research on the foundations of multisensory intelligence through a new theoretical framework formalizing how modalities interact with each other to give rise to new information for a task. These interactions are the basic building blocks in all multimodal problems, and their quantification enables users to understand their multimodal datasets and design principled approaches to learn these interactions. To further learn temporal interactions from sequential data, I will present cross-modal attention and multimodal transformers which now underpin many of today’s multimodal foundation models. Finally, I will discuss broader real-world applications of scaling up multisensory learning to many modalities and tasks: (1) aiding mental health practitioners in their treatment by predicting daily mood fluctuations in patients using multimodal smartphone data, (2) supporting doctors in cancer prognosis using genomics readings and pathology images, and (3) enabling robust control of physical robots using cameras and touch sensors.

**Talk Title:**Efficient Deep Learning with Sparsity — Algorithms, Systems and Applications

**Abstract:** Deep learning has catalyzed advancements across numerous scientific and engineering fields. It is also a driving force behind many successful real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, large language models, and generative AI. Despite its remarkable accomplishments, the computational requirements of deep learning have surged dramatically. For instance, the model size of large language models is increased from 0.11B parameters in GPT-1 to 175B in GPT-3 within three years, an over 1500X growth. However, the pace of hardware acceleration has slowed down in the post-Moore era. This raises a large (and potentially growing) gap between the supply and demand of AI computing.

In this talk, I will introduce my research efforts on efficient deep learning with sparsity. I will first talk about my efforts on developing efficient sparse algorithms and systems. I will mainly focus on TorchSparse that effectively translates the theoretical savings from activation sparsity to practical speedups. It is three times faster than the leading industry solution from NVIDIA. I will then delve into my efforts on incorporating sparsity into different applications, such as computer vision, robotics and high-energy physics. To conclude, I will provide a glimpse into some of my ongoing research projects and outline my long-term research vision.

These observations may contain signatures of new physics, including hints about the nature of dark matter, offering significant discovery potential. At the same time, the complexity of the data and the presence of unknowable systematics pose significant challenges to robustly characterizing these signatures through conventional methods.

I will describe how overcoming these challenges will require a qualitative shift in our approach to statistical inference in astrophysics, bringing together several recent advances in generative modeling, differentiable programming, and simulation-based inference. I will showcase applications of these methods to diverse astrophysical systems, emphasizing how these will drive progress on key questions in astro- and particle-physics over the next decade.

**Talk Title:**Learning from a Biased Sample

**Abstract:** The empirical risk minimization approach to data-driven decision making assumes that we can learn a decision rule from training data drawn under the same conditions as the ones we want to deploy it in. However, in a number of settings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased, and that some groups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be under- or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this setting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield rules that perform well at deployment. We propose a model of sampling bias called Gamma-biased sampling, where observed covariates can affect the probability of sample selection arbitrarily much but the amount of unexplained variation in the probability of sample selection is bounded by a constant factor. Applying the distributionally robust optimization framework, we propose a method for learning a decision rule that minimizes the worst-case risk incurred under a family of test distributions that can generate the training distribution under Gamma-biased sampling. We apply a result of Rockafellar and Uryasev to show that this problem is equivalent to an augmented convex risk minimization problem. We give statistical guarantees for learning a model that is robust to sampling bias via the method of sieves, and propose a deep learning algorithm whose loss function captures our robust learning target. We empirically validate our proposed method in simulations and a case study on ICU length of stay prediction.

**Talk Title:**Towards Useful AI Interpretability for Humans via Interactive AI Explanations

**Abstract:** Although the plethora of eXplainable AI (XAI) approaches are validated to reflect the model behavior faithfully, how humans can understand and further use AI explanations still needs to be explored. Therefore, we conducted two human studies to investigate how much AI explanations can be useful for end users in Computer Vision and NLP fields, including asking humans to analyze model failures in image classification tasks and simulate model predictions in text classification tasks, respectively. Our results showed that explanations are not always helpful for human understanding in practical tasks of both fields. To gain insights into possible reasons, we examined the gaps between the status quo of XAI techniques and real-world user demands, by surveying 200+ XAI papers and comparing them with the practical user needs. As a result, we found that humans need diverse XAI types to interpret the whole AI system lifecycle. However, there is a lack of one-size-fits-all XAI techniques to cater to the diverse and dynamic human needs in practice. Hence, we propose a Conversational XAI prototype, ConvXAI, as a universal XAI dialogue interface that empowers users to request various XAI questions across AI lifecycle and receive explanations with diverse formats. We applied ConvXAI to improve human performance in the human-AI co-writing tasks. The findings from two studies with 21 users show that ConvXAI is useful for humans in understanding AI feedback and improving writing productivity and quality. Overall, the studies contribute insights into the design space of facilitating useful XAI techniques for humans in practice.

My research focuses on neural-symbolic reasoning, which entails synergistically leveraging the strengths of machine learning systems with symbolic systems such as knowledge graphs and combinatorial optimization solvers. More recently, my research interests have been oriented towards the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), with a special emphasis on improving reliability through scalable oversight (minimal human supervision) such as human-defined principles or factual feedback from real-world interactions.

**Talk Title:**Aligning Large Language and Multimodal Models with Scalable Oversight

**Abstract:** There has been an increasing desire to bridge the gap between what we expect AI systems to generate and what they actually produce. At the forefront of this exploration, we introduce novel methodologies for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs): Principle-Driven Self-Alignment (SELF-ALIGN), Self-Alignment with Principle-Following Reward Models (SALT), and Aligning Large Multimodal Models with Factually-Augmented RLHF (Fact-RLHF). Driven by the aspiration to diminish the constraints of exhaustive human supervision and to magnify the reliability of AI outputs, SELF-ALIGN ingeniously harnesses principle-driven reasoning with LLMs’ generative prowess, crafting content that resonates with human values. Building on this motivation, SALT evolves the alignment landscape further by seamlessly integrating minimal human guidance with reinforcement learning from synthetic preferences, offering a tantalizing glimpse into the future of self-aligned AI agents. Shifting our lens to the multimodal realm, where misalignment often translates into AI “hallucinations” that are inconsistent with the multimodal inputs, Fact-RLHF emerges as a general and scalable solution. By merging RLHF’s strength with factual augmentations, this method not only mitigates misalignments but also pioneers in setting robust standards for AI’s vision-language capabilities.

**Talk Title:**Deep Interpretable Generative Learning for Science and Engineering

**Abstract:**Discriminative and generative AI represent two deep learning paradigms that have sparked a revolution in predicting and generating high-quality realistic images from text prompts. Nonetheless, discriminative learning lacks the capacity to generate data, while deep generative models face challenges in decoding capabilities. A key challenge, which could brought the next breakthrough in AI, lies in the unification of these two paradigms. Moreover, both deep learning approaches are data-hungry and thus does not perform well in data-scarce applications. Furthermore, deep learning suffers from low interpretability; no comprehensive framework exists to describe construction of non-trivial representations and predictions by discriminative models. These drawbacks have posed significant barriers to the adoption of deep learning in applications where a) acquiring supervised data is expensive or infeasible, and b) goals extend beyond data fitting to attain scientific insights. Specifically, deep learning applications are fairly unexplored in fields with rich mathematical and optimization frameworks such as inverse problems, or those in which interpretability matters. This talk discusses the theory and applications of deep learning in data-limited or unsupervised inverse problems. These include applications in radar sensing, Poisson image denoising, and computational neuroscience.

**Talk Title:**Leveraging Large Language Models for Remediation in Mathematics Tutoring: Insights and Challenges

**Abstract:** In this talk, I will present our study of how experienced teachers and large language models (LLMs)  
remediate student mistakes in mathematics and outline the potential of LLMs to support novice tutors  
at scale.

Scaling high-quality tutoring is a major challenge in education. Because of the growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike professional educators, struggle to effectively address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities for students. In this work, we explore the potential for LLMs to assist math tutors in remediating student mistakes. We analyze thousands of tutoring sessions from novice tutors, which reveal poor pedagogical practices like immediately saying and explaining the solution when responding to student mistakes. We used these findings to build ReMath, a benchmark co-developed with experienced math teachers that deconstructs their thought process for remediation. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art instruct-tuned and dialog models on ReMath. Our findings suggest that although models consistently improve upon original tutor responses, we cannot rely on models alone to remediate mistakes. Providing models with the error type (e.g., the student is guessing) and strategy (e.g., simplify the problem) leads to a 75% improvement in the response quality over models without that information. Nonetheless, despite the improvement, the quality of the best model’s responses still falls short of experienced math teachers. Our work is the first to shed light on the potential and current limitations of using LLMs to provide high-quality learning experiences for both tutors and students at scale.

**Talk Title:** What creates edge of stability, balancing, and catapult

**Abstract:**When large learning rate is used in gradient descent for nonconvex optimization, various phenomena that are not explainable by classical optimization theory can arise, including edge of stability, balancing, and catapult. There are a lot of theoretical works trying to analyze these phenomena, while the high level idea is still missing: it is unclear when and why these phenomena occur. In this talk, I will show that these phenomena are actually various tips of the same iceberg. They occur when the objective function of optimization has some good regularity. This regularity, together with the effect of large learning rate on guiding gradient descent from sharp regions to flatter ones, leads to the control of the largest eigenvalue of Hessian, i.e., sharpness, along the GD trajectory, which results in various phenomena. This result is based on the nontrivial convergence analysis under large learning rate on a family of nonconvex functions of various regularities without Lipschitz gradient which is usually a default assumption in nonconvex optimization. In addition, it contains the first non-asymptotic result on the rate of convergence in this circumstance. Neural network experiments will also be presented to validate this result.

**Talk Title:**Theoretical Insights into Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent in Deep Learning

**Abstract:**Gradient Descent (GD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are fundamental optimization algorithms in machine learning, but their behaviors sometimes defy intuitions from classic optimization and statistical learning theories. In deep learning, GD often exhibits local oscillations while still converging over time. Moreover, SGD-trained models generalize effectively even when overparameterized. In this talk, I will revisit the theories of GD and SGD for classic problems but in new scenarios motivated by deep learning, presenting two novel insights:

(1) For logistic regression with separable data, GD with an arbitrarily large stepsize minimizes empirical risk, potentially in a non-monotonic fashion.

(2) For linear regression and ReLU regression, one-pass SGD and its variants can achieve low excess risk, even in overparameterized regime.

**Talk Title:**High-stakes decisions from low-quality data: AI decision-making for planetary health

**Abstract:** Planetary health recognizes the inextricable link between human health and the health of our planet. Our planet’s growing crises include biodiversity loss, with animal population sizes declining by an average of 70% since 1970, and maternal mortality, with 1 in 49 girls in low-income countries dying from complications in pregnancy or birth. Overcoming these crises will require effectively allocating and managing our limited resources. My research develops data-driven AI decision-making methods to do so, overcoming the messy data ubiquitous in these settings. Here, I’ll present technical advances in multi-armed bandits, robust reinforcement learning, and causal inference, addressing research questions that emerged from on-the-ground challenges across conservation and maternal health. I’ll also discuss bridging the gap from research and practice, with anti-poaching field tests in Cambodia, field visits in Belize and Uganda, and large-scale deployment with SMART conservation software.

**Talk Title:**Learning to Assess Disease and Health At Your Home

**Abstract:** The future of healthcare lies in delivering comprehensive medical services to patients in their own homes. As the global population ages and chronic diseases become increasingly prevalent, objective, longitudinal and reliable health assessment at home becomes crucial for early detection and prevention of hospitalization. Advances in machine learning and smart sensors hold immense potential for transforming in-home healthcare. However, enabling these technologies for at-home clinical applications requires addressing several challenges, including discovering effective biomarkers with accessible vitals, learning from real-world sparse and biased health data, and making ML algorithms reliable for deployment across diverse environments and populations.

In this talk, I will present new learning methods with everyday devices for in-home healthcare that address these challenges. I will first describe a simple self-supervised framework for remote human vitals sensing just using daily smartphones. I will then introduce an AI-powered digital biomarker for Parkinson’s disease that detects the disease, estimates its severity, and tracks its progression using nocturnal breathing signals. Furthermore, I will showcase the potential of AI-based in-home assessment for various diseases and human health sensing, enabling remote monitoring of health-related conditions, timely care and enhancing patient outcomes.

**Talk Title:** Labor advantages drive the greater productivity of faculty at elite universities

**Abstract:**Faculty at prestigious institutions dominate scientific discourse, producing a disproportionate share of all research publications. Environmental prestige can drive such epistemic disparity, but the mechanisms by which it causes increased faculty productivity remain unknown. Here, we combine employment, publication, and federal survey data for 78,802 tenure-track faculty at 262 PhD-granting institutions in the American university system to show through multiple lines of evidence that the greater availability of funded graduate and postdoctoral labor at more prestigious institutions drives the environmental effect of prestige on productivity. In particular, greater environmental prestige leads to larger faculty-led research groups, which drive higher faculty productivity, primarily in disciplines with group collaboration norms. In contrast, productivity does not increase substantially with prestige for faculty publications without group members or for group members themselves. The disproportionate scientific productivity of elite researchers can be largely explained by their substantial labor advantage rather than inherent differences in talent.

**Talk Title:**DProvDB: Differentially Private Query Processing with Multi-Analyst Provenance

**Abstract:**Recent years have witnessed the adoption of differential privacy (DP) in practical database systems like PINQ, FLEX, and PrivateSQL. Such systems allow data analysts to query sensitive data while providing a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee. However, the existing design of these systems does not distinguish data analysts of different privilege levels or trust levels. This design can have an unfair apportion of the privacy budget among the data analyst if treating them as a single entity, or waste the privacy budget if considering them as non-colluding parties and answering their queries independently. In this paper, we propose DProvDB, a fine-grained privacy provenance framework for the multi-analyst scenario that tracks the privacy loss to each single data analyst. Under this framework, when given a fixed privacy budget, we build algorithms that maximize the number of queries that could be answered accurately and apportion the privacy budget according to the privilege levels of the data analysts.

**Talk Title:**Towards Trustworthy AI: Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms that Produce All Good Models

**Abstract:**Machine learning has been increasingly deployed for high-stakes decisions that deeply impact people’s lives. However, not all models can be trusted. To ensure the safe and efficient utilization of machine learning models in the decision-making process, we change both model training and evaluation steps within the standard machine learning pipeline. In this talk, I will introduce our new paradigm, which shifts from finding a single optimal model to enumerating all good interpretable models. This paradigm allows users an unprecedented level of control over model choice among all models that are approximately equally good. I will present algorithms used to find the set of all good models, discuss how this set enables practitioners to explore alternative models that might have desirable properties beyond what could be expressed within a loss function, and show applications.
