**Abstract:** In this talk, I will describe recent efforts to bring AI out of the digital realm of bits and pixels and into the material world as living machines of diverse size, shape, composition, and niche. While the resulting creatures are exceedingly simple by modern standards, I will argue that they open the way to understanding and realizing higher forms of intelligence.

**!Sam Kriegman** is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science, Chemical and Biological Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. Sam and his students enjoy creating new kinds of simulations, robots, and AI with the ultimate goal of understanding how animals evolve, grow, move, sense, and think.
