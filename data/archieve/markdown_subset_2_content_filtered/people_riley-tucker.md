# Riley Tucker

Postdoctoral Scholar, Department of Psychology, University of Chicago

DSI Postdoctoral Scholar 2022-2024

Riley Tucker was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation and the Data Science Institute at the University of Chicago. His work seeks to advance and develop scientific theories about cities and neighborhoods using computational methods to merge traditional data sources with geospatially informed online data sets such as Twitter, Yelp, and Foursquare. His theoretical approach is strongly inspired by the classical Chicago School of sociology, with his dissertation proposing a strategy for measuring social disorganization among ambient populations using geotagged Twitter posts. He is excited to investigate how old ideas formulated at the University of Chicago can help us understand a new and changing world. He holds a PhD in Criminology and Justice Policy from Northeastern University and a BA in Sociology from Temple University.
