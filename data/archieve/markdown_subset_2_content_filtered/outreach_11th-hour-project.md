# 11th Hour Project Software and Data Hub

A centralized hub supporting software and data science for grantees of the 11th Hour Project, which serves nonprofits in energy, food and agriculture, human rights, and marine technology.

The DSI serves as a centralized hub for software and data science for 11th Hour Project grantees. The [11th Hour Project](https://11thhourproject.org/), part of [The Schmidt Family Foundation](https://tsffoundation.org/), serves nonprofits in four main impact areas: energy, food and agriculture, human rights, and marine technology. DSI research staff work to lower the barriers to mission-driven data science through education, consultation, project-based applications and collaboration. UChicago students have the opportunity to drive social and environmental impact through projects with 11th Hour grantees through the [Data Science Clinic](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/data-science-clinic/), [DSI Summer Lab](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/), and ongoing research collaborations.
