The Data Science Institute (DSI) [AI+Science Research Initiative](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/) is hosting a social for faculty, research staff, and postdocs on May 12th from 3:00-4:30pm in the East Lounge of the [Ida Noyes Hall](https://maps.uchicago.edu/?location=Ida+Noyes+Hall) (1212 E. 59th St). The event will begin with remarks from Dean Angela Olinto and Prof. Rebecca Willett (DSI Faculty Director of AI and Co-Lead of the AI+Science research initiative). The event will then move into brief lightning talks and small group discussions of important strategic directions. Refreshments will be served.

On the registration form, you will be able to opt into presenting a brief, 2-minute lightning talk (no slides). This is an opportunity to share either existing research in AI+Science or to pose high-level questions pertinent to the area for discussion.
