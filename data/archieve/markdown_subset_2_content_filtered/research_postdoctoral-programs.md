# Postdoctoral Programs

Unique opportunities for early-career scientists who wish to advance cutting-edge data science approaches, methods, and applications in research.

Data Science Institute postdoctoral programs provide unique opportunities to early-career scientists who wish to advance cutting-edge data science approaches, methods, and applications in research. The core DSI postdoctoral program allows scholars to deepen their knowledge of cutting-edge data science and computing research while developing additional expertise in a specific, applied problem domain.

We also offer postdoctoral positions within our research initiatives, and participate in the [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship, a program of Schmidt Futures](https://aiscience.uchicago.edu/).

Our annual [Rising Stars in Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/postdoctoral-programs/rising-stars/) event celebrates exceptional data scientists at a critical inflection point in their career: the transition to postdoctoral scholar, research scientist, industry research position, or tenure track position.

We also maintain a partnership between the University of Chicago and City Colleges of Chicago to train the next generation of data science educators through our [Preceptors in Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/preceptors/) program.
