# Application

Applications for summer 2025 are now closed. If you have already submitted an application, you will hear back in March.

#### **Program Eligibility**

Grade/year: High school applicants must reside and attend school in the Chicago area. Undergraduate applicants must be enrolled in college in fall 2025 (graduating college seniors are not eligible). Current high school seniors who will be starting college in fall 2025 will be categorized as high school applicants and therefore must be located in the Chicago area. Graduate students are not eligible.

International students: International students are eligible to apply so long as they are able to provide documentation to support their work authorization in the United States. If you have specific questions about your eligibility, contact your international student office.

Housing: We provide optional housing for college students as part of this program. We are not able to provide housing to minors, and high school students of any age (including current high school seniors) are responsible for arranging their own housing and transportation.

Programming familiarity: Applicants should have some familiarity with at least one programming language.

#### **Application Materials**

* Resume
* Research keywords and description of interest (150 words max)
* Technical skills self-evaluation
* Personal statement (400 words max)
  * Please speak to your interest in data science, mathematics, and/or computer science; any previous related experiences (school-related or otherwise) that you have enjoyed; any obstacles you have faced along the way; and your experience collaborating with and supporting your peers.
* Internship goals (300 words max)
  * Why do you want to participate in this program? What role will it play in your personal and academic growth? Which program goals particularly resonate with you?
* Project description (300 words max)
  * Describe a project you’ve undertaken. It can be a final project from a class, a side project, or one from a previous research program. In detail, describe: (1) the goals of the project and your approach; (2) one challenge you faced and how you addressed it; (3) one achievement from the project of which you’re particularly proud. With this question, more value will be placed on how you approached the project, rather than how advanced or technical it is.
* Link to an artifact (optional)
  * Please provide a link to something that shows off your prior work. For example, a project report, GitHub account, personal website, blog post, LinkedIn profile, or a paper.
* Letter of recommendation (optional)
  * The letter can come from a teacher, coach, mentor, employer, etc. and should speak to your enthusiasm about learning, research, and/or community. Recommenders can submit letters [here](https://forms.gle/dCASBjp4o4oaDGSTA).

#### **Evaluation Criteria**

Applications will be reviewed by the Summer Lab Review Committee using the following factors:

* Intellectual Curiosity: Evident interest about data science and the applied domain areas chosen.
* Skills Baseline: Familiarity with at least one programming language, and translation of self-evaluated skills ratings in CV/relevant coursework/other experiences.
* Program Fit: Clear why this program is valuable to the student. Evident interest in being part of a cohort group and doing research in a community.
* Potential for Growth: Evidence that the program will have an outsized impact on applicant’s growth (e.g., limited previous research experience/access, future career path in data science or related field).
* Teamwork: Demonstrated ability to work successfully as part of a team.
* Research Aptitude: Creativity and curiosity, self-direction and initiative, goal-oriented and adaptable work ethic, resilient problem solving, time management and communication skills.

#### **Equal Opportunity Statement**

We seek a diverse pool of applicants who wish to join an academic community that places the highest value on rigorous inquiry and encourages diverse perspectives, experiences, groups of individuals, and ideas to inform and stimulate intellectual challenge, engagement, and exchange.
