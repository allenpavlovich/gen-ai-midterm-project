# Anthony Badea

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Anthony Badea is an experimental particle physicist interested in understanding fundamental aspects of nature. Using high energy particle collisions, Badea provides new insights into searches for Beyond the Standard Model physics and matter in extreme conditions, similar to those of the early universe. He has pioneered machine learning based searches in many jet final states of proton proton collisions and studies of high-density quantum chromodynamics using electron-positron collisions. He aims to build the next-generation of experiments to understand properties of the Higgs boson and nature of dark matter by developing AI-engrained chips, sensors, and techniques.

**BIO**:

Anthony Badea received dual bachelor’s degrees in Physics and  Mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in  2019, where he worked under Professors Yen-Jie Lee and Jesse  Thaler. Then he moved to Harvard University, where he received a  master’s degree in Physics in 2020 and a Ph.D. in Physics in 2023 while working under Professor John Huth.
