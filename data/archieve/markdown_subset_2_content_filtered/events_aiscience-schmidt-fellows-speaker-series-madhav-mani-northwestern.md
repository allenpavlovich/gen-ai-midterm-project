**Abstract:** Inspired by the mysteries and structural connectivity of the brain, John Hopfield developed general class of learning networks, which are both used as a model to understand brain function and mimic its computational capabilities for an enormous diversity of uses. Here, I will use as inspiration Waddington’s metaphor for the robustness of evolved systems behaving as a ball rolling down in a canalized landscape that is held up by a complex network of genetic factors. I will present 3 recent investigations from our team ([1](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.21.614191v1__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!80Eok6AuYF-hvZsPby3F2iwJ6161RopjXWWHxJvGTVlaj-0bJKR9Zc9klDqMzFvTS7I8Ot0Vud3A6sZfcB_MZVM$), [2](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.26.605398v2__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!80Eok6AuYF-hvZsPby3F2iwJ6161RopjXWWHxJvGTVlaj-0bJKR9Zc9klDqMzFvTS7I8Ot0Vud3A6sZflJBDzTA$), and [3](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.033098__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!80Eok6AuYF-hvZsPby3F2iwJ6161RopjXWWHxJvGTVlaj-0bJKR9Zc9klDqMzFvTS7I8Ot0Vud3A6sZfe95_hwE$)) where we leverage neural networks to study the origins and consequences of this powerful dynamical systems analogy in the context of the dynamics of cellular, embryonic, and MNIST digit differentiation.
