# Communicating Complexity: Amplifying Geospatial Research with Webmapping and Interaction

January 8, 2021 2:00 PM – 3:00 PM

Zoom

Innovative geospatial research deserves equally innovative communication and cartography. By translating research projects into new and engaging formats beyond a PDF or presentation, different audiences can be exposed to exciting research methods and results. This talk reviews the research publication to interactive webmap/ visualization pipeline used by data visualization specialists and researchers at MIT’s Senseable City Lab. Dylan Halpern, Principal Software Engineer at CSDS, presents several recent webmapping/data visualization projects from initial research manuscript to final interactive map and website, and the design, research, and technologies that inform this process.
