Having helped lead the adoption of data science throughout baseball, including creating the Chicago Cubs analytics department, Ari will lead a lively discussion on the most up-to-date business trends for building data & AI at scale and velocity, and how businesses are now training their own proprietary LLMs on their own data with transparency, governance, and explainability.
