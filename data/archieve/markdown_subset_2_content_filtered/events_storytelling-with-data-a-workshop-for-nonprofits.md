# Data Storytelling for Nonprofits: Assessing Current Capacity and Needs

October 26, 2023 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM

Virtual Event

Learn how data can help you tell your organization’s story. In this workshop, we will use a data maturity assessment tool to better understand your organization’s current data practices and goals. We will discuss connecting your mission to data practices, developing a data strategy, and identifying the data you have or need to achieve your goals. Participants will leave with a baseline snapshot of their organization’s data maturity and resources to implement learnings.

This workshop is Session 1 of Data Storytelling for Nonprofits, a three-part workshop series from the Data Science Institute. This series is centered on how nonprofit and social sector organizations can leverage data effectively to tell the stories and impact of their work. These workshops will provide you with resources and tools for assessing your data practice, strategies for meaningfully communicating data, and resources for building further data capacity.

This workshop is open to all nonprofit professionals and social sector leaders interested in building data culture and capacity within their organizations. No previous data science experience is required.

This workshop is led by Ari Zickau (they/he), the Community Data Fellows Program Manager with the Data Science Institute at UChicago. The [Community Data Fellows](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/community-data-fellows/) program pairs UChicago data science graduate students with nonprofits to help build data capacity for organization, analytics, visualizations, and more.
