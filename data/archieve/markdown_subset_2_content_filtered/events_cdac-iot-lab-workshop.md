# CDAC IoT Lab Workshop

Tour our new Internet of Things lab and learn how to work with connected devices and the data they collect to study security, privacy, and network performance.

January 23, 2020 3:00 PM – 5:00 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 279

The **Internet Of Things (IoT)** market is predicted to grow at $520B in valuation by 2021, more than double the $235B spent in 2017, according to Forbes. The increasing popularity of these “smart” IoT consumer devices raises many interesting research questions. At the [CDAC IoT Lab](/iot-lab), we replicate your home broadband network inside an experimental laboratory to study security, privacy, and network performance. By hosting several IoT devices (powered by [CableLabs](https://www.cablelabs.com/)), we provide a unique opportunity for you to experiment with new and existing datasets, apply data science and machine learning techniques to uncover new insights and valuable information, or build your new application or research project.

At this workshop, we’ll provide a tour of the devices and tools available in the CDAC IoT Lab, and show you how to access and analyze the data these devices collect, both in our workspace and in your own home. The workshop runs one hour, and **space is very limited**, so [please sign up for either the 3pm or 4pm slot](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cdac-iot-lab-workshop-tickets-88907393407). [1/14 UPDATE: The event is full, but you can sign up for the waitlist or fill out the form [here](/iot-lab/) for information on future session.]
