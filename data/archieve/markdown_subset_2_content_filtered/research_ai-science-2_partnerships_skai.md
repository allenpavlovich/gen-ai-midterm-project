# The US National Science Foundation and Simons Foundation-funded SkAI Institute

The US National Science Foundation and Simons Foundation-funded SkAI Institute is synergistically accelerating astro-AI research while also educating and expanding the astro-AI workforce.

The [SkAI Institute](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://skai-institute.org/__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!_Mj-R_cWZEwJlFyGBKJtMu_tzvDncOLy5XTClKk__tPZw9fbhoL8fL772m0OnMagIyfS7FeBIvIBfEkzVM3ISLqcAIol$) serves as a hub by bringing together 25 partner organizations and being centrally located in Chicago and the Midwest. The institute acts as a cross-disciplinary nexus by bringing together astrophysicists, foundational AI researchers, educators, AI-ethicists, software engineers, and artists to:

1. Confront the challenges posed by transformative multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.
2. Develop innovative, trustworthy AI tools for the research community.
3. Seed and nurture a generation of interdisciplinary leaders in science and engineering to ethically apply and extend AI within and beyond academia.
