# Elizabeth Barnes

Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University

Prof. Elizabeth Barnes is a Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. She joined the CSU faculty in 2013 after obtaining dual B.S. degrees (Honors) in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Minnesota, obtaining her Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science from the University of Washington, and spending a year as a NOAA Climate & Global Change Fellow at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Professor Barnes’ research is largely focused on climate variability and change and the data analysis tools used to understand them. Her current work is heavily focused on developing and applying explainable machine learning methods to better understand and anticipate climate impacts in the coming decades to support humanity as we navigate our turbulent future. Dr. Barnes received the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Macelwane Medal and became a Fellow of the AGU in 2021, received the AGU Turco Lectureship in Future Horizons in Climate Science in 2020, and the American Meteorological Society Clarence Leroy Meisinger Early Career Award in 2020.
