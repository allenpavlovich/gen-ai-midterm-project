HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE Study

# Bootstrap: Data Science

## At-A-Glance

Format

Bootstrap is a set of 29 online web-based lessons with optional projects. Student worksheets can be printed on site or purchased as a bound workbook.

Programming Language

Bootstrap uses a programming language called Pyret with lessons also available in  CODAP.

Standards Alignment

Bootstrap provides alignment information for the Common Core State Standards for mathematics and English language arts, the Computer Science Teacher Association Standards, various mathematics textbooks and individual state standards.

Assessment

Bootstrap provides assessment rubrics for every project.

Prerequisites

Bootstrap has no identified prerequisites.

Cost

Bootstrap materials and its cloud-based software are free.

Professional Development

Bootstrap offers a variety of PD models to best meet the needs of their partners and teachers. Accordingly, the cost varies. One model, for example, calls for  5 days in the summer and 4 academic-year sessions. Another is 3 days in the summer with 2 days before the beginning of the academic year. All include coaching sessions. Costs start at $1800 per teacher.

## Key Features

* Flexible structure
* Emphasizes civic responsibility
* Printable student workbook

## Instructional Practices:

Bootstrap’s lessons emphasize coding as well as the data science cycle and  data storytelling. Its design calls for students’ to work alone, in pairs or groups, and as a whole class. They are expected to actively engage in the lessons as they participate in collaborative problem-solving,  critical thinking, and  communication. Bootstrap uses a “notice and wonder” strategy throughout the lessons, asking students to observe data and then ask questions.

Accordingly, the lessons call on teachers to facilitate group work and discussion and to support students’ engagement in critical thinking. Teachers are also expected to support students’ reflection, curiosity and skepticism as they work. With Bootstrap’s periodic teacher guidance, teachers have a lot of flexibility to make their own decisions about how best to implement these pedagogical strategies.

## Lesson Structure:

Bootstrap lessons have both student-facing and teacher-facing content with pdf worksheets for each lesson that can be printed separately or purchased as a workbook. (Users who want to do their own workbook printing can obtain the entire workbook pdf for free.) Additionally, for some lessons Bootstrap has linked Desmos activities for teachers to use if they wish. While the lessons are teacher-facing, most of the lesson content is intended to be student-facing. The student-facing content is available on slides for teachers who want to use them.

The lessons begin with a teacher-facing text block that includes some or all of the following sections: lesson goals, prerequisite lessons (within Bootstrap), materials needed (with links to slides, pdf student handouts, and starter files) supplemental materials, student preparation and key instructional points for the teacher. They also include a glossary for terms specific to the lesson. Each lesson has 2-5 sections labeled with their intended duration. Within each part, the lesson activities are labeled with one of the following headings: overview, launch, investigate, synthesize. The online lessons also include “Teacher Tips,” examples of student answers, and common student misconceptions. They also have periodic messages to teachers focused on a range of topics from additional instructional activities to practical matters such as IT.

## Design Features:

One of the most notable features of Bootstrap’s design, compared to others, is its intentional adaptability and flexibility. Bootstrap was designed to be used with a wide range of student age groups from 7th -12th grade and can range from a semester to a year. To accommodate this range, Bootstrap has flexibility in the number of lessons a teacher uses as well as the depth to which students engage with data science concepts through optional activities. Teachers also have space to adapt lessons to their students’ needs and to supplement the curriculum for further enrichment.

Of all of the curricula, Bootstrap has lessons that are most explicit about inclusion and diversity as well as  data responsibility  . The first lesson in fact, uses images of data scientists from groups underrepresented in STEM. They also take the position that data science education should include: domain of study, computing, statistics and mathematics and civic responsibility. Further, the fifth unit is focused on “using data responsibly.” Bootstrap also emphasizes the  data science cycle  and data storytelling. Like the other curricula, Bootstrap includes projects as well as authentic data sets examples designed to be relevant for the students.

Finally, Bootstrap teaches students using a coding language called Pyret. Pyret development was informed by research and has been specifically designed for classroom contexts. Lessons that use CODAP are also available.

## Teacher Support Materials and Resources:

Bootstrap provides a range of data sets for teachers and students to choose from. Other support materials include help videos, a bilingual glossary of terms, a range of classroom visuals, homework submission templates and templates for other student activities. The Bootstrap leaders facilitate an online community for asking questions and communicating with other Bootstrap teachers.
