# Understanding and Auditing Content Moderation Policies

Combining computer science and law approaches to conduct an empirical study of the moderation policies and practices of popular social media platforms.

Internet and social media platforms face growing challenges in moderating the content posted by users, deploying a range of policies to find, flag, and remove offensive or inappropriate material. This study will combine computer science and law approaches to conduct an empirical study of the moderation policies and practices of platforms such as Youtube, Reddit, Facebook, and Etsy, creating the first public corpus of these policies and auditing how these systems are applied in real situations. The researchers will also conduct surveys and interviews to assess how users of these platforms perceive these policies and their expectations for how content rules will be enforced.

Principal Investigators: Marshini Chetty (Associate Professor, Computer Science), Chenhao Tan (Assistant Professor, Computer Science and Data Science), Nick Feamster (Neubauer Professor of Computer Science), and Genevieve Lakier (Professor of Law).
