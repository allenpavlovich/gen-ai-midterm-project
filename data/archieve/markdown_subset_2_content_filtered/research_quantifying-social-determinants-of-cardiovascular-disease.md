# Quantifying Social Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease

Corey Tabit, Marynia Kolak, and Elizabeth Tung

Physicians, epidemiologists, and spatial data scientists produce a new cardiovascular disease model that combines clinical and social risk factors.

Cardiovascular disease is the #1 killer of American adults. Preliminary data suggest that community social risk factors such as violent crime events, closures of food stores or pharmacies, and outages along critical mass transit lines are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events and worsened control of cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol. The project will determine how community stressors relate to cardiovascular events and develop a prediction model and a prototype software tool to identify patients at highest risk for cardiovascular events during their periods of peak risk, so that healthcare providers can more efficiently target interventions to the patients who need them most.

Principal Investigators: Thomas Covert (Adjunct Professor, Economics), Michael Greenstone (Milton Friedman Distinguished Service Professor in Economics)
