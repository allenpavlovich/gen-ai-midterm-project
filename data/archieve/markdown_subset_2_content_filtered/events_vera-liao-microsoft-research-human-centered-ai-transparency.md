Transparency—enabling appropriate understanding of AI models or systems—is considered a pillar of Responsible AI. The AI research community and industry have developed an abundance of techniques and artifacts in the hope of achieving transparency, including transparent model reporting, model evaluation, explainable AI (XAI), and communication of model uncertainty. Meanwhile, the human-computer interaction (HCI) community has taken human-centered approaches to these topics, building on its long-standing interests in design to support user understanding and appropriate mental models. In this talk, I will give an overview of common approaches and lessons learned from HCI research on AI transparency. With the recent rise of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-infused systems, I will also reflect on their unique challenges in providing transparency and discuss open questions.

**Bio**: [Q. Vera Liao](http://qveraliao.com/) is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Montréal, where she is part of the FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in AI) group. Her current research interests are in human-AI interaction, explainable AI, and responsible AI, with an overarching goal of bridging emerging AI technologies and human-centered design practices. Prior to joining MSR, she worked at IBM Research, and studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Tsinghua University. She has authored more than 60 peer-reviewed research articles and received many paper awards at ACM and AAAI venues.
