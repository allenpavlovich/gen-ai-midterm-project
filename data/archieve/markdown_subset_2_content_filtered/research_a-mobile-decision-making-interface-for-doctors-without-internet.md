# Mobile Decision-Making for Doctors Without Internet

Andrey Rzhetsky, and Pedro Lopes

Create a mobile Android app for physicians working in areas with poor internet coverage, enabling data-driven medical diagnosis and medical record access in the field.

A large sector of the medical profession in Nigeria lacks traditional decision making systems because of inadequate internet infrastructure, and the country has no electronic medical records. This project will build a mobile system running on conventional Android devices that allows doctors in this region to access basic medical records and perform queries (such as “side effects of diazepam”) over encrypted text messages, as well as access real-time information on the spread of diseases such as contagious infections.

Principal Investigators: Andrey Rzhetsky (Edna K. Papazian Professor of Medicine), Pedro Lopes (Associate Professor, Computer Science)
