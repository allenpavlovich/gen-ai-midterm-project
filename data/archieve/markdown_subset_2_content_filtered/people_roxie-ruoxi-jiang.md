# Roxie (Ruoxi) Jiang

PhD Student

Roxie is a Computer Science PhD student at [the University of Chicago](https://cs.uchicago.edu/) advised by [Professor Rebecca Willett](https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu/). Previously, she received her master’s degree in Operations Research at [Columbia University](https://www.ieor.columbia.edu/) and bachelor’s degree at [Xi’an JiaoTong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).

Roxie’s research interests lie in machine learning for dynamical systems and its applications in scientific computing. In particular, she works on learning structural hidden representations of the high-dimensional data. Her work has been applied to addressing inverse problems with uncertainty quantification and designing practical algorithms to achieve data efficiency in decision-making problems (i.e., bandits). Currently, she is interested in predicting high-dimensional chaotic systems with deep learning.
