# Bradie Ferguson

Undergraduate, University of Washington

**Project:**Radiomic Texture Analysis of Immunofluorescence Images of Lupus Nephritis Biopsies to Predict Patient Progression to End Stage Renal Disease

**Mentor:** [Maryellen Giger](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/faculty/maryellen-l-giger-phd), Department of Radiology

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning & AI // Image Analysis // Medicine & Health

**Project Description:**Bradie Ferguson is a pre-med senior at the University of Washington studying bioengineering and chemistry. This summer, she continued work with Drs. [Maryellen Giger](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/faculty/maryellen-l-giger-phd) and [Madeleine Durkee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madeleine-durkee-03412537/) on an image analysis project on microscopic images of lupus nephritis biopsies. The goal was to create a multi-feature classifier that can distinguish between patients that progressed to end stage renal disease (ESRD+) and those that did not progress (ESRD-). To accomplish this, radiomic texture analysis was utilized with future plans of using machine learning.
