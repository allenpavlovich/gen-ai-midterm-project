# NITMB

The NSF-Simons National Institute for Theory and Mathematics in Biology (NITMB) integrates the disciplines of mathematics and biology to transform the practice of biological research and inspire new mathematical discoveries.

The [NSF-Simons National Institute for Theory and Mathematics in Biology (NITMB)](https://www.nitmb.org/), a partnership between Northwestern University and the University of Chicago funded by the National Science Foundation and Simons Foundation, is creating a nationwide collaborative research community. This community is generating new mathematical results to uncover the “rules of life” through theories, data-informed mathematical models, and computational and statistical tools. The NITMB leverages close collaborations between experimentalists and theorists to synergize discovery. The fundamental research done by NITMB will stimulate advances in areas as diverse as the environment, medicine, and technology development. NITMB members and visitors share space in downtown Chicago that is readily accessible to collaborators across the world.

NITMB uses an interlocking set of strategies and initiatives that help develop a diverse workforce while ensuring broad impacts on the mathematical and biological research communities.

* Targeted research bringing together mathematicians and biologists to collaborate and train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.
* Scientific long programs, workshops, and conferences enhancing collaboration between mathematics and biology.
* An innovative research program organized around five interrelated themes, selected because they reflect key capabilities of biological systems and interconnect with open mathematical problems.
