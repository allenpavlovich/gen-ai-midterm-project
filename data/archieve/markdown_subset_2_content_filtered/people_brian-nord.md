# Brian Nord

Associate Scientist, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory; Visiting Research Assistant Professor, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics

Brian Nord uses artificial intelligence to search for clues on the origins and development of the universe. He actively works on statistical modeling of strong gravitational lenses, the cosmic microwave background, and galaxy clusters. As leader of the [Deep Skies Lab](http://www.deepskieslab.com/), he brings together experts in computer science and technology to study questions of cosmology, including dark energy, dark matter, and the early universe, through large-scale data analysis.

Nord has authored or co-authored nearly 50 papers. He trains scientists in public communication, advocates for science education and funding, and works to develop equitable and just research environments. As co-leader of education and public engagement at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at UChicago, he organizes [Space Explorers](http://kicp.uchicago.edu/education/explorers/), a program to help underrepresented minorities in high school engage in hands-on physics experiences outside the classroom. He is an associate scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, where he is a member of the Machine Intelligence Group.
