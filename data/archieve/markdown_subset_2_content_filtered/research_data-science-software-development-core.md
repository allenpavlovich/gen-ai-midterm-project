# Data Science Software Development Core

The Data Science Software Development Core facility provides software development and data science services across the University.

The Data Science Software Development Core facilitates the development of tools and technologies which further the mission of the Data Science Institute and the University of Chicago as a whole.

Our core mission is to:

* Increase the impact of Data Science Institute (DSI) Research by making available high-quality code that lowers the barrier to adoption of new tools by academic, government and industrial researchers.
* Support translation of DSI projects to practical applications.
* Strengthen grant proposals by increasing the availability of resources to faculty.
* Decrease the costs associated with implementing the computational aspects of data science research projects by providing fractional human capacity to projects.
* Educate a diverse and inclusive next generation of ethically minded and socially conscious data science leaders who are driven to use their skills to create positive change in the world.

Our primary work is with the Data Science Institute (DSI) and DSI affiliates, but we are not exclusive and are able to work on projects from across the University.

#### Rates and Billing

The Data Science Software Development Core Facility is a University of Chicago recharge operation. Bills are issued monthly based on the number of hours worked on each project and cloud computing costs. Monthly bills are sent to each user. Price rates are determined annually based on the standard recharge operation accounting rules.

Payments can only be made using a University account number – cash, credit, or any other payment methods are not accepted.

The following rates are currently in effect for our services:

* Cloud computing costs: These are pass through rates and are charged based on the costs we incur.
* Software Development and Data Science Activities: We charge a flat rate of $125 per hour for  
  this service.
