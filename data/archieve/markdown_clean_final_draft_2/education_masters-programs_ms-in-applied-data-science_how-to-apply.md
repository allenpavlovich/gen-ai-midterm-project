We *strongly recommend* that at least one letter is written by someone such as a direct manager/supervisor or internship supervisor who can attest to skills you demonstrated or gained though a professional workplace experience (e.g., leadership, teamwork, collaboration, initiative, management, other).

Note: Letters of recommendation can be uploaded after you submit your application. Recommended sources for letters of recommendation include: professors; supervisors or managers; professional mentors.

We do not accept letters of recommendation from family members, friends, or peers.

### Candidate Statement

The candidate statement is a key part of your application. The admissions committee pays careful attention to how you understand and present your aims and qualifications. The application will include a prompt with detailed instructions on the information the program is looking for in your candidate statement.

Best practices to keep in mind as you write:
* Do not restate your resume.
* Your statement should not exceed 1,000 words.

### Resume/CV

The Master’s in Applied Data Science admissions committee will review your resume. We encourage you to take the time to carefully update the resume you submit to us.

Important to Include:

* Major accomplishments and awards
* Educational background, including areas of study

### Programming Supplement

Your [application](https://apply-psd.uchicago.edu/apply/) contains a section on programming skills.

Include a PDF of *no more than two pages* demonstrating current programming language skills.

Examples include a PDF submission of work completed in R or Python. The programming supplement must be shared as a PDF file. We are looking for the following in your code (see below). Please note your code does not need to contain all of the below.
* Ingest data from csv
* Manage different data types
* Use your function for data analysis
* Visualize data
* Wrangle data
* Write your own function
* Import libraries

### Virtual Portfolio

The MS in Applied Data Science requires short, recorded videos to a given prompt(s) within the application. These short videos give applicants an alternative means to outline why they are a strong fit for the MS in Applied Data Science program.

One video prompt response is required; the other is optional. Each video should be approximately 1:30 minutes in length.

### International Students

* The in-person, full-time program only intakes students for the Autumn start.
* Only the full-time, in-person program is visa-eligible.
* International students are also welcome to apply to our Master’s in Applied Data Science Online program, which does not require citizenship or permanent resident status and does not provide visa sponsorship.
