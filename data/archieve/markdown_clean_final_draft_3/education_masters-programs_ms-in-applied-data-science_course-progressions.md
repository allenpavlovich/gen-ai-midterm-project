## Course Progressions

Use the interactive visualization below to view a sample course schedule for the In-Person and Online program options.

### Flexible Formats

We prepare you to advance in the competitive data science field with a focus on industry applications. Full- and part-time options are available in both the [Online](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/) and [In-Person](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/) formats. Full-time students take 3 classes per quarter (300 units). Part-time students take 2 classes per quarter (200 units).

A sample schedule for the MBA/MS is available on the [Booth website](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/joint-degree/mba-ms-applied-data-science).

*Please note: Course offerings are subject to change. The Pass/Fail Career Seminar is a degree requirement for all students unless eligible to waive. There is no tuition or fees for the Career Seminar. Similarly, the optional foundational noncredit courses are available at no additional cost.*

### Sample Full-Time Schedule

#### **Prequarter** • 5 Weeks

**Optional**

##### Introduction to Statistical Concepts (Foundational) Optional

This course, held in the 5 weeks before your first quarter, provides exposure to basic statistical concepts necessary for understanding advanced program content. 0 units, no cost.

##### R for Data Science (Foundational) Optional

This course, also held in the 5 weeks before your first quarter, introduces essential concepts and techniques for the statistical computing language R. 0 units, no cost.

#### **Quarter 1** • 10 Weeks

**Optional**

##### Python for Data Science (Foundational) Optional

This course runs concurrently with the first five weeks of your first quarter and introduces the basic syntax and environment of the Python programming language. 0 units, no cost.

##### Advanced Linear Algebra for Machine Learning (Foundational) Optional

If required, this course is held during the second five weeks of your first quarter. It focuses on theoretical concepts and real-life applications of linear algebra for machine learning. 0 units, no cost.

**Core**

##### Statistical Models for Data Science Letter Grade

In traditional linear models, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response is a linear combination of predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) developed this framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has dominated statistics and data science for nearly two centuries. New methods based on non-Gaussian probability distributions emerged only in the latter half of the twentieth century, enabling analysis of variables across broader domains and distributions. Additionally, new methods for analyzing general associations, distinct from Pearson correlation, were developed.

##### Leadership and Consulting for Data Science Letter Grade

Organizations value data science when it advances their strategic goals, and the job market rewards data scientists who use data to support organizational interests, whether as external consultants or within internal teams. To become successful and marketable leaders, data scientists need strategic awareness to align data and business requirements, technical proficiency to select appropriate methodologies, and communication skills to execute plans as part of a team and persuade others of their findings.

**Core (Choose 1)**

##### Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing Letter Grade

Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage. Big Data and Cloud Computing covers approaches to big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data, and multiple emerging software packages exist; the course covers the most popular approaches.

**Seminar**
