## Master’s in Applied Data Science Summer 2024 Capstone Winners

MS in Applied Data Science students deliver impactful solutions through capstone projects.

The Capstone Project is a cornerstone of the [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program, pairing students with industry partners to address real-world data science challenges. At the recent Summer Showcase, students presented a diverse range of innovative projects. Six teams were recognized for their outstanding work.

Greg Green, Senior Instructional Professor and Director of the MS in Applied Data Science program, reflected on the Capstone Showcase: “The advanced AI and Data Science Capstone projects completed this summer spanned many technical areas including NLP, Computer Vision/Deep Learning, Advanced Machine Learning, and Large Language Models just recently made available. We continue to be impressed not only with the advanced thinking within the technical solutions but the clarity of communication and presentation styles that make these solutions understandable to senior business leaders from a variety of domains of expertise.”

Peerapak Adsavakulchai, one of the Summer Capstone winners, noted that his team’s strength was their diverse backgrounds, with members from trading, consulting, and data science-driven research. This diversity brought unique perspectives and skills to the project.

### FTI Consulting | FTI Chat

Presenters: Peerapak Adsavakulchai, Jason Rajan, Kanu Madhok, James McKenzie

Faculty Advisor: Abid Ali

Project Topic: This capstone group developed an AI-powered business development tool for FTI Consulting. FTI and other consulting companies operate on a project-to-project basis, making it difficult to maintain traditional, efficient databases like those used by transactional businesses. Much of the data exists in “inefficient” file types. FTI Chat, a chatbot leveraging LLMs, automates project approach creation based on client needs. It retrieves past project data using RAG and generates responses via an open-source LLM. Due to its ease of use, FTI Chat has the potential to become a staple product deployed independently, enabling different teams to streamline their business development processes.

### Independent Student Project | Federal Government Contract Dollar Awards to Small Businesses for Fiscal Year 2023

Presenters: Zhengliang Jiang, Alexander Saucedo, Yansong Guo

Faculty Advisor: Anil Chaturvedi

Project Topic: For the past three fiscal years, the United States government has failed to meet prime contract award goals for Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses as established in the Small Business Act 15 U.S.C. 644(g). To understand the shared attributes of these two business categories and those that met the award goals, this study analyzes 2023 federal contract awards using autoencoding models for dimensionality reduction and t-SNE for visualization to identify clusters. The team’s findings provide insights into which agencies and contract types were awarded to various small business categories.

### Tilia Holdings | Strategic Growth in Food Manufacturing and Distribution: Natural Language Processing Approach

Presenters: Kinjal Joshi, Jaelynn Kim, Benjamin Li, Sophia Fumagalli

Faculty Advisor: Gizem Aydin

Project Topic: Tilia Holdings, a private equity firm specializing in food manufacturing and distribution investments, lacks an in-house approach for market research. This team used natural language processing (NLP) to create a tool for analyzing earnings call transcripts of major food companies. The tool provides current and historical strategic focus, market outlook, and maturity and sentiment analysis. It aims to reduce Tilia’s market research costs, provide proactive insights, and enhance investment success.
