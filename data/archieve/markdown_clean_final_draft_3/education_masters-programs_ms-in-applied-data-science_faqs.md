Students must also present an employment offer letter to complete the application process. Please visit the University of Chicago [Office of International Affairs website](https://internationalaffairs.uchicago.edu/) for more information.

### I have worked in the U.S. for more than two years. Does that mean that I am exempt from the TOEFL/IELTS requirement?

No, you must take the TOEFL or IELTS if you do not meet the waiver criteria. Please refer to the University of Chicago’s English Language Proficiency requirements and the [English Language Proficiency](https://grad.uchicago.edu/admissions/apply/english-language-requirements/) section of the FAQs for more details.

## Online Program

### If I am a student in the In-Person Master's in Applied Data Science Program, may I take courses in the Online Program? Conversely, if I am a student in the Online Program, may I take courses in the In-Person program?

Currently, students may only take Master’s in Applied Data Science courses in the modality in which they are officially enrolled.

### Do I need to be a US citizen or permanent resident to apply to Master's in Applied Data Science Online Program?

No, students do not need to be US citizens or residents to participate in the [Online Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/). Please note that the [Online Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/) is *not* eligible for visa sponsorship.

### How will enrolling in Master's in Applied Data Science Online Program impact my schedule? Are classes held synchronously, asynchronously, or both?

Classes generally take place on evenings and weekends to allow students and instructors to maintain their professional schedules. The Master’s in Applied Data Science [Online Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/) includes both synchronous and asynchronous components. As with the [In-Person](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/) program, students are required to participate in weekly live meetings with instructors and peers, complete readings and coursework, and engage in discussions.

### Will enrolling in Master's in Applied Data Science Online Program give me the opportunity to network with on-campus students, faculty/instructors, and advisors?

Yes. All Master’s in Applied Data Science Online Program students are invited to an annual ‘[Immersion Weekend](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/)’ where attendees can network and participate in other activities. Additionally, Career Services will advertise opportunities to connect with employers and peers (e.g., virtual career fairs, virtual career advising/coaching appointments, and more).

### What value do employers place on the Master's in Applied Data Science Online degree?

Employers place significant value on the Master’s in Applied Data Science degree. As they hire Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Data Analysts from the University of Chicago, expectations for technical competence, communication and influence skills, and exposure to advanced Data Science technologies are high. The skills learned in the program translate directly into practice due to the program’s balance between theory and rigorous application experience developed in coursework and Capstone project work.

### Is the Master's in Applied Data Science Online program equally academically rigorous as the In-Person program?

Yes. The [Online Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/) curriculum is overseen by the same faculty curriculum committee as the In-Person program. Both programs are jointly reviewed and held to the same high standards. Both degrees are granted by the University of Chicago [Physical Sciences Division](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/).

### Will my diploma indicate I completed the Master's in Applied Data Science Program Online?

No, your diploma will *not* include ‘Online’ in the name of your degree.

## MBA/MS

### How do I apply to the MBA/MS joint degree program?

Applicants interested in the Joint MBA/MS degree should apply through [Booth’s centralized, joint-application process](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/admissions/apply). Complete the Chicago Booth Full-Time MBA [application](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/admissions/apply) and select the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science as your program of interest. An MBA/MS program supplement will be available within your Booth application. The supplement contains Applied Data Science-specific questions that will be reviewed by the Applied Data Science admissions team along with your full Booth application. For full consideration, complete the MBA application and the joint degree program supplement in the same application round before submitting.

### What courses will I take in the MBA/MS program?

As a student in the [joint-degree MBA and Applied Data Science program](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/joint-degree/mba-ms-applied-data-science), you’ll take the equivalent of 23 100-unit courses:
* 14 MBA classes
* 9 data science courses
* Leadership Effectiveness and Development (LEAD)
* Qualified Work Experience, a noncredit professional internship experience

Your Booth courses will be in person, while your MS courses will be online. Most students earn both degrees in seven quarters—the same time it takes to earn the MBA.

### Will MBA/MS courses be in-person or online?

Your Booth courses will be in person, while your MS courses will be online. Most students earn both degrees in seven quarters—the same time it takes to earn the MBA. A combination of online and in-person courses provides flexibility in scheduling, and you’ll earn two degrees in the time it would take to complete the MBA alone.

### Are standardized tests required for admission?

As part of the online application, candidates must submit a GMAT or GRE score for the joint program. International applicants may be required to submit proof of English language proficiency by submitting a TOEFL iBT or IELTS test score. The minimum TOEFL iBT score required is 104; the minimum IELTS score required is 7. Proof of English proficiency may be waived under certain criteria noted by UChicago GRAD Admissions.

### What are the main differences in programs and outcomes between the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science compared to Computer Science?

The fields of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science intersect with industry domains in different ways. The [MPCS](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/joint-degree/mpcs-mba) program focuses on core Computer Science, including Software Engineering, High Performance Computing, Data Analytics, and Application Development. The MS-ADS Program focuses at the intersection of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics (including Statistical Inference, Linear/Non-Linear Models, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning). Outcomes for MPCS students include Software Engineer (Developer), Senior Software Engineering Management, Software/Hardware Architect, and Senior Cyber Security Engineer. Outcomes for MS-ADS students include roles as Data Scientist (most common), Senior Data Science Consultant, Business Intelligence (BI) Director, Data Visualization Manager, Data Analytics Engineer, and AI Solution Architect.
