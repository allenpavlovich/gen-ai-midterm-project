# The MS in Applied Data Science Program Celebrates 10 Years

On October 10, 2024 the University of Chicago marked a significant milestone with the 10th anniversary of its [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program. Formerly known as the MS in Analytics, the program has evolved into a cornerstone of data science education, producing a generation of skilled professionals who are driving innovation across multiple industries. The program sits within the [Physical Sciences Division](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/) which has a rich history of defining and advancing new fields in physical and mathematical science.

These distinguished individuals shared their insights on the program’s journey and its transformative impact on the field of data science.

Arnab Bose, Associate Senior Instructional Professor and Program Director of the Online Program, recalled the program’s humble beginnings in the windowless basement of Gleacher Center. Despite the modest surroundings, there was a clear vision from the outset: to create a program that would lead the way in data science education and innovation.

In their remarks, speakers emphasized the program’s evolution over the past decade and its bright future. Alison Ossyra celebrated the accomplishments of alumni, while Ka Yee Lee shared a poignant quote from a [Chicago Maroon 2013 article](https://chicagomaroon.com/17787/news/graham-offers-analytics-degree/). The quote, reflecting on the program’s inception, noted, “It is rare that a statistics program will venture beyond the classroom setting to integrate industry data sets or case studies in the curriculum or provide students with opportunities to interact with colleagues or potential employers outside of academia.” Greg Green spoke to the program’s rapid growth, with over 550 current students and 1,400 alumni, and David Uminsky underscored the importance of the Data Science Institute’s collaboration with the program. Alumni representatives Elijah Ampo and Kshitij Mittal encouraged graduates to stay connected and involved.

The success of the program is evident not only in the numbers but also in the remarkable impact it has had on its alumni over the past decade. Jorge Argueta, a 2020 graduate of the program, shared a piece of advice for prospective students considering applying: “Don’t think too much about it; just do it! It has transformed my career since I moved to Chicago and was part of the program. All the knowledge I learned in the program and brought back to my organization has helped me file my first patent, which was approved.”

This celebration marks not only a decade of excellence but also a commitment to driving greater innovation and impact in the years to come. Program faculty and staff are excited to continue shaping the future of data science by empowering its students and alumni to make meaningful contributions to industries, communities, and research worldwide.
