# Ming-Long Lam, PhD

Assistant Clinical Professor

I am a full-stack data scientist, software developer, and educator with diverse backgrounds. I have thirty years of experience in applying data science in commercial software development, property and casualty insurance, and retail financial service industries. I specialize in algorithm development with an emphasis on statistical learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I co-published the book “Using Data Analysis to Improve Student Learning: Toward 100% Proficiency” in 2006. I published the e-book “A Practitioner’s Guide to Machine Learning” in 2020.

I received my Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Chicago.
