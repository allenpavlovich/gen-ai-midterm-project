# Sai Krishna Jasti (he/him), MSDS ’24

Sai is a second-year graduate student in the MS in Applied Data Science program. He did his undergrad in Electronics and Communication Engineering and he has ~1.5 years of experience in Supply Chain, Logistics and Operations. As a Community Data Fellow, Sai worked on a project for Climate Cabinet and building interactive maps for the client. These maps serve as a tool to identify the areas where IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) tax credits can be maximized and better serve disadvantaged communities. He is also worked on an annotation project for mBio which will be used as the training data later for building a supervised machine learning model.
