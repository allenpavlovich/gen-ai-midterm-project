Our project focused on determining spatiotemporal individual and composite social risk scores as they relate to blood pressure. This summer, we aimed to identify the optimal spatiotemporal buffer of crime that affects people’s blood pressure most.

*Project News:* The paper that grew out of this research, titled, “[Acute Effects of Violent Crime on Blood Pressure in Chicago](https://www.onlinejacc.org/content/75/11_Supplement_1/1844.abstract),” was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in March 2020.
