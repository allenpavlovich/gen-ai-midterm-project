# Pedram Hassanzadeh

Associate Professor, Geophysical Sciences; Member, Committee of Computational and Applied Mathematics; Faculty Director, AI for Climate

I am an associate professor at the Department of Geophysical Sciences and [Committee of Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu/). Before joining UChicago, I was a tenured associate professor at Rice University. I received my Ph.D. (geophysical turbulence) and M.A. (applied mathematics) from UC Berkeley in 2013 and was a Ziff Environmental Fellow at the Harvard University Center for the Environment and Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences from 2013 to 2016. I received a CAREER Award from NSF in 2021 and a Young Investigator Award from the Office of Naval Research in 2020.

I lead the Climate Extremes Theory and Data (C*e*TD) group focused on integrating theory, simulations, observations, and machine learning techniques to understand the dynamics and future changes of extreme weather events in a changing climate.
