This summer, he continued worked on two projects: one with [Prof. Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/) in the [SUPERGroup Lab](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/members.html) where he helped design an evaluation study for a Jupyter Notebook plugin created to help people who develop machine learning models better understand the data they use to train their model; and a second one with [Prof. Nick Feamster](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/) where he installed smart devices at home and collected packet captures while implementing firewall rules generated for those devices, examining how the rules impact a device’s functionality and security.
