Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project:**Safety Guidelines for BLM Activists

**Mentor:** [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/), [SUPERGroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Security & Privacy // Society & Policy

**Project Description:**Maia Boyd is a sophomore at the University of Chicago majoring in computer science and minoring in math. This summer, she worked with [Prof. Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/) in the [SUPERGroup Lab](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/) on a project that seeks to understand the computer security and technology safety concerns that Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporters have surrounding protests, and how they address those concerns. In order to achieve this goal, she helped to collect safety guides used by BLM protesters to see what advice is given to protesters. Next, the project team launched an online survey, taken by 167 BLM protesters, that asked about their concerns and if they had heard of or follow the pieces of advice that we collected from the safety guides.
