**Abstract:** Increasingly, IT and business executives talk about information as one of their most important assets or “the new oil”. But few behave as if it is. Executives report to the board on the health of their workforce, their financials, their customers, and their partnerships, but rarely the health of their information assets. And corporations typically exhibit greater discipline in managing and accounting for their office furniture than their data.

In this session, Mr. Laney will share insights from his best-selling book, Infonomics, about how organizations can actually treat data as an actual enterprise asset. He will discuss why information both is and isn’t an asset and property, and what this means to organizations themselves and the investment community. And he will cover the issues of data ownership, rights, and privileges, along with alternative data challenges and opportunities, and his set of generally accepted information principles culled from other asset management disciplines.

This session will be beneficial for those looking to help their organization move beyond the trite “data is an asset” or “data is the new oil” lip-service to begin acting that way. Participants will learn and have an opportunity to discuss:

– How to monetize data assets in a wide variety of ways, including a number of real-world examples  
– How to manage data as an actual asset by applying asset management principles and practices from other asset domains  
– How to measure data’s potential and realized value to help budget for and prove data management benefits  
– How classic microeconomic concepts can be applied to data for improved data architecture & management, and economic benefits
