# Teresa Lee

High Schooler, Sacred Heart Canossian College (Hong Kong)

**Project: funcX Website Design**

**Mentor/Lab:** [Ryan Chard](https://labs.globus.org/people.html)/[Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/people.html)

**Research Area Keywords:** Databases // Programming Languages // Website Design

This summer, I worked on [funcX](https://labs.globus.org/projects/funcx.html) web service, which is a serverless supercomputing project. It allows users to write, edit, delete, and execute functions over mobile devices with registered endpoints. I mainly worked on the user interface – the website – by writing codes to determine the design of webpages and ways of extracting data from the database with Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL codes.
