# Alma Gashi

Undergraduate, Minerva University

**Mentor:** [Eamon Duede](https://eamonduede.com/)

**Project Title:** Evolution of Annoyingness

**Project Description:**We analyzed the time and the sentiment (as a contributing factor to the emotion of irritation) of the tweets from a data pipeline we had created using the Academic Twitter API. Leveraging Machine Learning algorithms, we found that the day of the month can be almost as predictive as the tweet content for predicting/classifying the sentiment.
