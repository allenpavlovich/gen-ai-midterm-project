# James Zou (Stanford) – Clinical Trials for AI and AI for Clinical Trials

October 14, 2022 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 390

*Part of the [Autumn 2022 Distinguished Speaker Series](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/autumn-2022-distinguished-speaker-series/).*

Clinical trials are the gatekeeper and bottleneck of medicine. In the first half of the talk, I discuss lessons learned from our systematic analysis of all the FDA-approved medical AI devices, which reveals key limitations in how AIs are evaluated (Wu et al. Nature Medicine 2021). Motivated by this, I share the design and results from our recent randomized prospective clinical trial evaluating EchoNet, a computer vision AI for assessing cardiac conditions. In the second half, I will discuss how to use AI (Trial Pathfinder) to make clinical trials more diverse and efficient (Liu et al. Nature 2021). Trial Pathfinder is used by pharma companies to guide new trials and was selected as a Top Ten Clinical Research Achievement.
