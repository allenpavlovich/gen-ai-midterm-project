Student Elinai Severiano Perez shares her final presentation with the Summer Lab cohort, faculty, and other students.

The University of Chicago Data Science Institute (DSI) is proud to announce the expansion of its successful [Summer Lab](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/) program through the establishment of the AI+Science Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site, funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/reu-research-experiences-undergraduates) (NSF). Over the next three years, the new REU Site will introduce exciting research opportunities for undergraduate students from across the US, advancing AI-enabled scientific discovery and strengthening the program’s longstanding commitment to hands-on learning.

Building on the foundation of the DSI Summer Lab—which has supported hundreds of students since its inception over a decade ago—the AI+Science REU Site will enhance the program by offering specialized training and mentorship in interdisciplinary fields at the forefront of science and technology. Led by Principal Investigator Kyle Chard and Co-Principal Investigator Rebecca Willett, the expanded program will fund 10 students each summer for an immersive eight-week experience. The Summer Lab program historically has admitted a cohort of 20-25 students, some of whom are sponsored by other funding sources.

“Our Summer Lab program has always been about enabling students to engage in real-world, impactful research,” said Chard. “The addition of the AI+Science REU strengthens our commitment to equipping students with the skills and experiences they need to excel at the intersection of AI and scientific discovery.”

The new REU site will provide participants with hands-on experience in five primary research areas alongside UChicago mentors: AI+Materials Science (Chibueze Amanchukwu), AI+Earth Science (Pedram Hassanzadeh), AI+Biology (Jai Yu), AI+Astrophysics (Brian Nord and Yuxin Chen), and AI+Neuroscience (Yuan Chang Leong). These new research foci will be offered alongside other long-running Summer Lab research projects around robotics, spatial data, health and medicine, and more.

The Summer Lab program will continue to prioritize collaborative learning, mentorship, and professional development. Participants will benefit from weekly seminars, social activities, career-building workshops, and sessions on research communication and ethics, all designed to support students’ academic and career growth.

The expansion of the Summer Lab program with the AI+Science REU Site underscores DSI’s dedication to expanding access to cutting-edge research experiences and increasing representation from underrepresented groups in STEM. The program aims to cultivate future leaders in AI and scientific research and contribute to the development of new interdisciplinary curricula and AI methodologies.
