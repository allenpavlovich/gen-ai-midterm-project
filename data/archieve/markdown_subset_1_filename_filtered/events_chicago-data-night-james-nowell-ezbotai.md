# Chicago Data Night: James Nowell (EZBot AI Company)

Events as a Data Quanta: How Thinking with Events and DDD (Domain-Driven Design) will make you a Stronger Data User

November 13, 2024 5:30 PM – 7:30 PM

Drive Capital, 215 N Peoria Street

Please join us for our monthly **Chicago Data Night**, cohosted by **[Drive Capital](https://www.drivecapital.com/)**, **[ChiData](https://uchi-db.github.io/chidatasite/)**and the **[DSI](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/)**. Practitioners, academics, and aficionados within the Chicago area are all invited to be part of a community at the intersection of industry and academia, brought together by a mutual interest in data. Each month, guest speakers will cover a specific data-related topic.

*Hors d’oeuvres and drinks will be provided. Admission is free, and we strongly encourage an [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/chicago-data-night/events/303833736/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=share-btn_savedevents_share_modal&utm_source=link) to attend. **Please note our new event location at Drive Capital!***

**Abstract:** In this talk, we’ll explore how thinking in Events and Domain-Driven Design can make you a stronger data producer and consumer. We’ll use [ezbot.ai](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://ezbot.ai__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!5Bl0moDaTUg7H88b4fHt9kFc5J1d0YjqoaibuIYrgFDKx90MRU21ZHaThSibPS35vMgDxhFegrXQCe6L4gU$)’s data pipeline as an example of this paradigm’s usefulness.

For most people, data means Rows and Columns in Tables. It means Entity-Relationship diagrams, SQL, and Joins. While this data modeling can be fantastically useful, it’s easy to “lose” lots of valuable information.

Rows frequently represent Entities. Entities may “change” over time; a User may move and change their Address. They may change their name or email. A Return may negate an Order. Without careful thought, these changes may cause an irrecoverable loss of information.

Enter Events: events are Facts about things that happened at a specific time. Events can describe changes to Entities, relationships, data points, and more. The State of an Entity can be reconstructed from the history of all of it’s relevant events. Treating Events as the Quanta of the data world can help ensure you never lose data and can always reconstruct information.

Using Events as a conceptual framework and Domain-Driven Design to explain how Entities and Events interact can help all data users better understand their domain.
