# Open Spatial Lab

The Open Spatial Lab at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute creates open source data tools and analytics to solve problems using geospatial data science.

The Open Spatial Lab (OSL) at the UChicago Data Science Institute creates open source tools and analyses to solve problems using geospatial data science. OSL’s mission is to diversify perspectives included in spatial data science practice and reach a broader audience through more accessible tools for data exploration, management, and visualization. The Lab works with community partners locally and across the U.S. to understand needs and uses to activate data for community and policy decision support.

The Open Spatial Lab works in partnership with the [Center for Spatial Data Science at University of Chicago](http://spatial.uchicago.edu).
