# Teresa Flanagan

Postdoctoral Scholar, Data Science Institute

Teresa (Tess) Flanagan joined DSI as a postdoctoral scholar in September 2024. She completed her Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology at Cornell University and was a postdoctoral researcher at Duke University. Tess’ research predominantly focuses on children’s engagement with interactive technologies, such as robots and AI. More recently, she is exploring how we may use these technologies to improve data collection methodologies in developmental psychology.
