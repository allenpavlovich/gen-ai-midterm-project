# Avery Schwartz

High Schooler, The University of Chicago Laboratory Schools

**Project: funcX Website Design**

**Mentor/Lab:** [Ryan Chard](https://labs.globus.org/people.html)/[Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/people.html)

**Research Area Keywords:** Programming Languages // Databases // Web Design

My project was to build a website for the Globus service, [funcX](https://labs.globus.org/projects/funcx.html) (a FaaS platform for science), which is designed to be applied to existing cyberinfrastructures to provide scalable, secure, and on-demand execution of short duration scientific functions. I learned how to use Bootstrap, Flask, and PSQL in order to construct a fully-functional website that scientists and researchers can use to remotely run functions with specified input data.
