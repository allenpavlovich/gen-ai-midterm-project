Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project: Making Spatial Access Measures Accessible: A New Python Package and AWS Tool**

**Mentors/Lab:** [Dr. James Saxon](https://saxon.harris.uchicago.edu/) & [Dr. Julia Koschinsky](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/directories/full/all)/[Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Medicine & Health // Spatial Data

I worked on a project aiming to help researchers calculate spatial access with a very simple interface. I made a website which allows users to easily calculate how easily people living in a certain location have access to a certain resource. This can be used to determine where there isn’t enough healthcare and other important goods.

***Project News:***The PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library) package in which this research project culminated is now [available](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#methods) online.
