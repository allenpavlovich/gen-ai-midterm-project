My work during the program centered on climate science: because clouds introduce uncertainty into climate projections, our project uses unsupervised machine learning methods to evaluate changing cloud characteristics. In my contribution to the project, I tackled the data processing issues brought on by immense but previously under-utilized NASA satellite data: through employing web scraping and API calls as well as mapping and other data visualization techniques, I simplified and expedited the data downloading and wrangling process.

*Project News:* Two papers arose from this research, and both were accepted to the American Geophysical Union Fall 2019 meeting: “[Cloud Characterization With Deep Learning II](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/492604)” and “[Developing Unsupervised Learning Models for Cloud Classification](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/612555).”
