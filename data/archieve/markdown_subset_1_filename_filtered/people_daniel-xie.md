**Project Title:**Exploring POV Effect for Stealthy Adversarial Patch Generation

**Project Description:**Facial recognition is becoming more popular nowadays, but how can we protect our privacy and prevent cameras from using images to recognize us? Using eyeware that projects light onto the face, flashing the light in a distinct pattern creates an effect called the “pov” effect, essentially making it so when cameras take an image of your face, the image will be distorted and recognition of the individual will fail.
