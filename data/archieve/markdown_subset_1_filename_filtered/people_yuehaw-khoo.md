# Yuehaw Khoo

Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics; Member, Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics (CCAM)

I’m an assistant professor at the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu/) at University of Chicago. I am also a member of [Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics (CCAM)](https://cam.uchicago.edu/). I am interested in computational problems in structural biology and quantum many-body physics. I was extremely fortunate to have [Amit Singer](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/) at Princeton as my Ph.D. adviser during 2012-2016, [Lexing Ying](http://web.stanford.edu/~lexing/) at Stanford as my post-doc mentor during 2016-2019, and [Phuan Ong](http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~npo/) at Princeton supervising my master thesis in experimental physics during 2010-2012.
