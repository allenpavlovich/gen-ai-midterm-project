**Project: Fairness in Machine Learning**

**Mentors/Lab:** [Prof. Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/), [Julia Hanson (BS 2018)](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/members.html), [Galen Harrison (PhD, CS)](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/members.html)/[SUPERGroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning // Human-Computer Interaction

I worked on the Fairness in Machine Learning project with SUPERgroup. We focused on analyzing empirical data to understand what people perceived to determine a fair machine learning model, among other things. I programmed in JavaScript to help work on a process visualization as part of the project. I also used JavaScript to try and develop summary statistics of the data that was collected as part of our project. I also did qualitative coding for the survey responses used in the project.

***Project News:***The paper that grew out of this research, titled “An Empirical Study on the Perceived Fairness of Realistic, Imperfect Machine Learning Models”, was [accepted](https://fatconference.org/2020/acceptedpapers.html) at the ACM FAT\* 2020 Conference.
