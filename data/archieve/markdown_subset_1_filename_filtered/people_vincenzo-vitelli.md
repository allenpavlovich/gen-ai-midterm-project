# Vincenzo Vitelli

Professor, Dept. of Physics, James Franck Institute, and the College

Vincenzo Vitelli’s research interests lie in condensed matter theory broadly defined. Recent work encompasses active matter, machine learning, metamaterials, topological insulators, hydrodynamics, dynamical systems, liquid crystals, granular media, glasses and polymers. Often the rich phenomenology of these many body systems arises from the interplay between strong non-linearities, disorder and physics far from equilibrium that he explores using analytical and numerical tools in close collaboration with experimentalists.
