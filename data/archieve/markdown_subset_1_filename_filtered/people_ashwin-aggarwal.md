After extracting metadata from over 26,000 surveyed authors, we ran relational analysis on our data and found a relationship between the influence of an author’s references and the geospatial distance between the author and referenced author’s institution. This relationship is intriguing and offers insight into understanding what types of publications are more influential for authors.
