**Abstract:**  **Why Asking the Right Questions Matters More Than Having All the Answers.**

We’re often fixated on answers – whether it’s getting to them first or ensuring they’re right. In this keynote, Neal is flipping the script and revealing why asking the right question is the true game-changer. We’ll dive into real-world scenarios in technology where the power of inquiry has led to unparalleled breakthroughs, unlocked new possibilities, and reshaped the tech landscape. Forget the race to solutions – join us as we explore how the questions you ask can become the catalyst for overcoming limitations and navigating complexity.
