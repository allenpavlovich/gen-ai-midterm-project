# Rana Hanocka

Assistant Professor, Computer Science

I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). I founded and direct 3DL (*threedle!*), a group of enthusiastic researchers passionate about 3D, machine learning, and visual computing. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2021 from Tel Aviv University under the supervision of [Daniel Cohen-Or](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/) and [Raja Giryes](http://web.eng.tau.ac.il/~raja).

My research is focused on building artificial intelligence for 3D data, spanning the fields of computer graphics, machine learning, and computer vision. Deep learning, the most popular form of artificial intelligence, has unlocked remarkable success on structured data (such as text, images, and video), and I am interested in harnessing the potential of these techniques to enable effective operation on unstructured 3D geometric data.

We have developed a [convolutional neural network designed specifically for meshes](https://ranahanocka.github.io/MeshCNN/), and also explored how to learn from the internal data within a single shape (for [surface reconstruction](https://ranahanocka.github.io/point2mesh/), [geometric texture synthesis](https://ranahanocka.github.io/geometric-textures/), and [point cloud consolidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06471)) – and I am interested in broader applications related to these areas. Additional research directions that I am aiming to explore include: intertwining human and machine-based creativity to advance our capabilities in 3D shape modeling and animation; learning with less supervision, for example to extract patterns and relationships from large shape collections; and making 3D neural networks more “interpretable/explainable”.
