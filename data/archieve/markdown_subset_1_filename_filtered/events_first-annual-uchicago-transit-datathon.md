Like data? Like transit? Like being creative? Come check out UCTEE’s first Datathon! You and a team of up to 3 other friends are encouraged to stop by and make something cool with bus and train data published by the CTA. You can build a tracker, a physical display, a browser extension, a game — whatever you want!

Mentors from the Computer Science department and professional data scientists will be available to answer any questions and give you some starting ideas. At the end of the evening, you will present to our panel of judges, and the highest ranking project teams will win a prize! Judging criteria will be released shortly.

The event will be held in the MADD Center in John Crerar Library. Dinner will be catered by UChicago Dining Services.
