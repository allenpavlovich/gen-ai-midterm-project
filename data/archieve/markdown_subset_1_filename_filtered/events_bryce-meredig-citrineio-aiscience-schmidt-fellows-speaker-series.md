**Abstract:** Over the past decade, venture capital (VC) firms have begun investing heavily in deeptech startups tackling global challenges such as decarbonization with high-risk, high-reward research. According to a report from the Boston Consulting Group[1], as of late 2023, deeptech accounts for 20% of all VC investment, and delivers financial returns on par with traditional VC funds. These developments are great news for aspiring entrepreneurs in academia, as university researchers are well-positioned to launch deeptech ventures.

In this talk, I will discuss my own deeptech startup journey as founding CEO and later Chief Science Officer of Citrine Informatics, a leading provider of AI for the materials industry. I will cover how the founding team came together, how we iterated toward product-market fit, and how Citrine evolved from a small startup to an established, growth-stage software company. I will also describe some key business and leadership learnings gained as a scientific entrepreneur along the path from a Ph.D. to an MBA to launching a rapidly growing Silicon Valley startup.
