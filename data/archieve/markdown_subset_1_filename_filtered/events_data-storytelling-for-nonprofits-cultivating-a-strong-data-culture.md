This workshop is Session 3 of Data Storytelling for Nonprofits, a three-part workshop series from the Data Science Institute. This series is centered on how nonprofit and social sector organizations can leverage data effectively to tell the stories and impact of their work. These workshops will provide you with resources and tools for assessing your data practice, strategies for meaningfully communicating data, and resources for building further data capacity.

This workshop is open to all nonprofit professionals and social sector leaders interested in building data culture and capacity within their organizations. This Session 3 is designed for participants who have completed a Data Maturity Assessment in Sessions 1 or 2 of the Data Storytelling for Nonprofits workshop series.
