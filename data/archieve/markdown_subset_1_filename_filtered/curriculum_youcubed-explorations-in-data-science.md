HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE Study / The Curriculum

# Youcubed: Explorations in Data Science

## At-A-Glance

Format

Youcubed is a set of 8 online project-based units. Lesson plans, slides and student handouts for the course are provided.

Programming Language

Youcubed uses  CODAP   
 and  EduBlocks   
 as well as technology tools such as Tableau and Google Data Commons, Sheets, and Colab using Python.

Standards Alignment

Youcubed provides alignment information for the Common Core State Standards for mathematics and English language arts as well as the California computer science standards.

Assessment

Youcubed provides criteria for assessing the projects at the end of each unit and explicit opportunities for student self-assessment. Over time, students compile their project work into a portfolio.

Prerequisites

Algebra 1 and Geometry or Math 1 and Math 2.

Cost

Youcubed materials are free.

Professional Development

Youcubed offers professional development in two formats: weekly 2-hour sessions during the academic year or 4 daylong sessions in the summer online or in person. The 4-day session is $1990 per person and $1800 per person for groups of 2 or more. Additionally, youcubed offers office hours and a community message board for support from other teachers implementing the curriculum.

## Key Features:

* Completely project-based with student relevant themes
* Uses CODAP, EduBlocks and Python in Google Colab
* Frequent and explicit opportunities for student reflection

## Instructional Practices:

Youcubed emphasizes data science and statistics concepts while addressing programming as called for within the context of each unit’s project-based theme. The lesson design focuses on authentic, student relevant datasets and has students work alone, in pairs, in groups and as a whole class in teacher guided interactive lessons. Youcubed students engage in  critical thinking, problem solving, and student communication regularly. The curriculum also aims to develop skepticism and reflection, and asks students to explore questions related to data ethics.

Each youcubed unit begins with a “data talk” or reading as a foundation for students sharing what they “notice” and what they “wonder.” Together, the lessons in each unit work through the data science process and end with an expectation that students communicate about their work. During the lessons, teachers are provided with guidance for facilitating class discussions as well as students’ critical thinking and engagement in the data science process. Youcubed also has “intermission” lessons that have students focus on a topic related to the unit task and frequently emphasize data ethics. Additionally, youcubed has prioritized student reflection by providing specific weekly reflection tasks. Lessons also provide links to multimedia resources to complement the content.

## Lesson Structure:

Each of youcubed’s 8 project-based units begins with an overview of the unit topics, the length of the unit, unit resources (such as weekly outlines), student handouts and sample student work. The lessons, designed to be 50 minutes, are teacher-facing but are accompanied by student-facing slides the teacher can use during class.

Each unit has 2-9 sections and then up to 11 headings in each section labeled with words like, “explore,” “discuss,” “share,” “gather data,” “organize data” and “reflection,” indicating the primary focus at that point in the learning experience. The teacher facing content provides directions for guiding students through their learning experience with suggested prompts and questions for class facilitation. There are also periodic Teacher Notes with guidance for teachers to consider. Youcubed also includes “important messages” to the teacher focused on a mathematics mindset and data science topics for teachers to consider.

## Design Features:

The most clear feature that distinguishes youcubed from the other curricula is the fact that all lessons are situated in the context of a larger theme. Accordingly, lessons all connect with the theme and lead to a culminating project. In addition to CODAP and EduBlocks as key non-text-based programming tools, youcubed uses a number of other technology tools such as Tableau and Python using Google Colab. The Youcubed project-based units are self-contained so there is some flexibility regarding the order in which they are taught.

Youcubed also has more frequent and concrete opportunities for student reflection compared to the other curricula. It provides several tools to support this including a student concept organizer for students to document concepts and vocabulary and designated reflection time. Youcubed also provides a rubric for students to reflect on their work with their groups.

#### Teacher Support and Resource Materials:

Youcubed has a number of teacher supports including help videos, links to teacher tutorials, and a community message board available to teachers who have completed the professional development. Additionally, it provides an outline of weekly 50 minute classes that summarizes the lessons and can assist with pacing. Youcubed also provides a full resource of sample student work from students with a variety of backgrounds and experiences.

Additionally, PD participants have access to a community bulletin board where they can communicate with other teachers and the developers. Youcubed also offers free office hours for one hour every other week and teachers can also communicate directly with developers by email.
