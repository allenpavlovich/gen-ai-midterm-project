**Project: Using Machine Learning to Identify Blurry SEM Images**

**Mentor/Lab:** [Ryan Chard/Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/people.html)

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning // Image Analysis // Systems & Architecture // Databases

I worked on a project using machine learning and computer vision to detect Scanning Electronic Microscope images of mice brains that were either blurry or focused. I was able to create three different models using first a Laplacian of Gaussian blob detection; then, a neural network; and finally a convolutional neural network. Then, I helped push the models to DLHub for others to use.
