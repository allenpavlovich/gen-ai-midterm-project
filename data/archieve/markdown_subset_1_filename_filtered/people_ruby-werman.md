**Research Area Keywords:** Biology & Environment // Image Analysis // Machine Learning

We explored how deep learning can be applicable to discover new cloud features from big satellite data. To find the new cloud features, we built a data analysis pipeline where we trained a deep neural network, extracted dimension-reduced clouds information, and then passed the compressed representation to a clustering algorithm.

*Project News:* Two papers arose from this research, and both were accepted to the American Geophysical Union Fall 2019 meeting: “[Cloud Characterization With Deep Learning II](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/492604)” and “[Developing Unsupervised Learning Models for Cloud Classification](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/612555).”
