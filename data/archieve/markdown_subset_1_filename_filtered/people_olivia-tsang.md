# Olivia Tsang

PhD Student

Olivia is a PhD student in computer science at the University of Chicago, advised by Prof. Rebecca Willett. She is interested in integrating physical knowledge into machine learning methods, particularly for solving nonlinear inverse problems. Currently, she is working on an inverse scattering problem that involves computationally reconstructing images of objects from wave scattering data. As a part of this work, she is exploring the use of a numerical partial differential equation (PDE) solver to improve the performance of neural network-based approaches. She previously received a Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Chicago.
