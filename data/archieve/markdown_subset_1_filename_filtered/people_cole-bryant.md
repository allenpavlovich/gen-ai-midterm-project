Masters Student, Masters Program in Computer Science, The University of Chicago

**Mentors:**Daniel Grzenda & [David Uminsky](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-uminsky/)

**Project Title:**Social Impact Track – Schmidt Ocean Institute, ROV Dive Processing

**Project Description:**In collaboration with the Schmidt Ocean Institute, our team was tasked with contributing to the foundation of an open source oceanographic video processing pipeline. Our primary goal was to implement an unsupervised video summarization model which will produce highlight reels of underwater ROV dive videos. Our secondary goal was to produce a pipeline which will tag dive video frames with informative labels using a variety of pixel-based algorithms and models.
