# Ethan Truelove

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project: Data and Learning Hub for Science (DLHub)**

**Mentors/Lab:** [Logan Ward & Ryan Chard](https://labs.globus.org/people.html)/[Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/people.html)

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning // Systems & Architecture

I began by working on [DLHub](https://www.dlhub.org/) by creating a module to extract data from various machine learning model architectures and translating them to PyTorch models. I then transitioned to learning about image segmentation, and attempting to determine whether transfer learning with image segmentation could be done efficiently.
