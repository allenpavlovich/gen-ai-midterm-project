# Daniel Sanz-Alonso

Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics and the College, Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics (CCAM)

Since 2018, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago, where I am a member of the Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics. Previously, I was a postdoc in the Division of Applied Mathematics and a member of the Data Science Initiative at Brown University. In 2016, I completed my PhD in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Warwick, UK, under the supervision of Andrew Stuart and Gareth Roberts.

My research interests are in inverse problems, data assimilation, and scientific machine learning. The main theme that drives my research across these three disciplines is the desire to blend complex predictive models with large data-sets, addressing theoretical and computational challenges motivated by data-centric applications. I was awarded the [José Luis Rubio de Francia](https://www.rsme.es/2021/07/daniel-sanz-alonso-premio-jose-luis-rubio-de-francia-2020/) prize to the best Spanish mathematician under 32 by the Spanish Royal Society of Mathematics, and received an NSF CAREER award in 2023.

I am grateful for the support of the National Science Foundation, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the Department of Energy, and the BBVA Foundation.
