# Neha Lingareddy

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project: Kubernetes Backend for VC3 + SLATE**

**Mentors/Lab:** [Dr. Rob Gardner](https://efi.uchicago.edu/people/profile/rob-gardner/), [Lincoln Bryant](https://efi.uchicago.edu/people/profile/lincoln-bryant/), & [Chris Weaver](https://efi.uchicago.edu/people/profile/chris-weaver/)/[MANIAC Lab](https://maniaclab.github.io/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Databases // Systems & Architecture

I iterated on scientific software projects [VC3](https://maniaclab.github.io/projects/vc3/) and [SLATE](https://maniaclab.github.io/projects/slate/) by replacing OpenStack backend to create ‘login pods’ that can be dynamically provisioned on a lightweight [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) backend, which could improve hardware usage by 2-3 times. I used tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins, and expanded my knowledge of Python, UNIX Shell programming languages, and Linux authorization and authentication mechanisms.
