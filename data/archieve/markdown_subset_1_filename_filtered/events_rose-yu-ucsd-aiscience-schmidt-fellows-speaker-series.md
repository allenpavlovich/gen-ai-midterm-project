**Abstract:** While AI has shown tremendous success in many scientific fields, it remains a grand challenge to incorporate physical principles in a systematic manner into the design and training of these models. In this talk, I will introduce Physics-Guided AI, a framework that aims to integrate first-principled physical knowledge into data-driven methods. By combining the best of both worlds, we can significantly improve sample complexity, computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and scientific validity of AI models. I will showcase the applications of this framework to accelerate hypothesis generation and discovery in various scientific disciplines.

!**Bio: Rose Yu** is an associate professor at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/)department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). She is a primary faculty with the [AI Group](http://ai.ucsd.edu/) and is affiliated with [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/). Her research interests lie primarily in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), especially for large-scale spatiotemporal data. She is particularly excited about AI for scientific discovery.
