# Molly Offer-Westort

Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science at The University of Chicago](https://political-science.uchicago.edu/).

I work on quantitative methodology for social science research, with a focus on causal inference, machine learning, and experimental design–particularly for adaptive experiments. My PhD is from Yale, joint in [Political Science](http://politicalscience.yale.edu/) and [Statistics & Data Science](http://statistics.yale.edu/).

Previously, I was a post-doctoral fellow in [Susan Athey’s](https://athey.people.stanford.edu/) [Golub Capital Social Impact Lab](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/centers-initiatives/sil) at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

In addition to the PhD, I hold a Masters in Statistics, also from Yale, and a Masters in Public Affairs, from the [Princeton School of Public and International Affairs](https://spia.princeton.edu/). My undergraduate degree was in cultural anthropology from Grinnell College; after college, I spent a year in Lesotho, teaching high school students, and two years in Madagascar, as a Peace Corps volunteer.
