# Dan Nicolae

Elaine M. and Samuel D. Kersten, Jr. Distinguished Service Professor, Departments of Statistics, Human Genetics, Medicine, and the College Section of Genetic Medicine; Faculty Co-Director, Data Science Institute

Dan Nicolae obtained his Ph.D. in statistics from The University of Chicago and has been a faculty at the same institution since 1999, with appointments in Statistics (since 1999) and Medicine (since 2006). His research focus is on developing statistical and computational methods for understanding the human genetic variation and its influence on the risk for complex traits, with an emphasis on asthma related phenotypes. The current focus in his statistical genetics research is centered on data integration and system-level approaches using large datasets that include clinical and environmental data as well as various genetics/genomics data types: DNA variation, gene expression (RNA-seq), methylation and microbiome.
