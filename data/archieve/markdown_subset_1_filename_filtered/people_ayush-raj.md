**Project Title:**Measuring Race and Gender Representation in Children’s Books Using Sentiment Analysis

**Project Description:**We measured race and gender representation in award-winning children’s books using sentiment analysis. Our goal was to find the sentiment towards characters to understand how different racial groups or genders are represented in these books. Sharing our findings with teachers, librarians, and parents will help us move towards a more equitable society.
