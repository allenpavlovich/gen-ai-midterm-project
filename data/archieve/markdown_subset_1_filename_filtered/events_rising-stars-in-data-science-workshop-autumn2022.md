The [Rising Stars in Data Science workshop](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/rising-stars/) at the University of Chicago **focuses on celebrating and fast tracking the careers of exceptional data scientists** at a critical inflection point in their career: the transition to postdoctoral scholar, research scientist, industry research position, or tenure track position. The Autumn 2022 workshop will showcase the exciting, innovative data science initiatives at UChicago as well as the research work of exceptional PhD students and postdocs.

Please note that this is a private workshop. We will be opening up registration to current UChicago PhD students and postdocs to attend the day 1 panels virtually. Registration information is forthcoming.

Below is a high-level agenda for the workshop, as of October 2022. Please note that this is subject to change. Speaker information is forthcoming.
