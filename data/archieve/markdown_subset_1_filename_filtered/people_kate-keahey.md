# Kate Keahey

Sr. Computer Scientist, Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory and the Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering (CASE), University of Chicago

Kate Keahey is one of the pioneers of infrastructure cloud computing. She created the [Nimbus project](http://www.nimbusproject.org/), recognized as the first open source Infrastructure-as-a-Service implementation, and continues to work on research aligning cloud computing concepts with the needs of scientific datacenters and applications. To facilitate such research for the community at large, Kate leads the [Chameleon project](http://www.chameleoncloud.org/), providing a deeply reconfigurable, large-scale, and open experimental platform for Computer Science research. To foster the recognition of contributions to science made by software projects, Kate co-founded and serves as co-Editor-in-Chief of the [SoftwareX](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/softwarex/) journal, a new format designed to publish software contributions. Kate is a Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory and a Senior Fellow at the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago.
