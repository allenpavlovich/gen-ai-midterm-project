# Aarthi Koripelly

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago
(Formerly High Schooler, Barrington High School)

**Project:**Extracting Scientific Information from Free Text Articles

**Mentor:** [Kyle Chard](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/kyle-chard/), [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning & AI // Systems // Medicine & Health

**Project Description:**Aarthi Koripelly is an incoming freshman at the University of Chicago studying computer science and statistics, a [2020 Coca Cola Scholar](https://www.coca-colascholarsfoundation.org/blog/our-2020-coke-scholars/), and a previous intern in the 2019 program. This summer, Aarthi worked with the [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/people.html) research group with [Dr. Kyle Chard](https://kylechard.com/) and [Zhi Hong](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/zhi-hong/), on a project that explored scalable approaches for automatically extracting relations from scientific papers (e.g., melting point of a polymer). The project implemented a dependency parser-based relation extraction model to understand relationships without the need for a Named Entity tagger and integrated several word embeddings models and custom tokenization to boost learning performance for scientific text.
