# Michelle Si

Undergraduate, Duke University (Formerly, High Schooler, The Harker School)

**Mentors:**[Dylan Halpern](https://dylanhalpern.com/) & [Julia Koschinsky](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/directories/full/team)

**Project Title:**In-Browser Spatial Analytics: Observable Notebook + WebGeoda Scaffolding

**Project Description:**This summer, I contributed to the creation of in-browser spatial analytics tools, which improve shareability and flexibility of geospatial research. With ObservableHQ, a Javascript environment, I built an interactive tutorial for exploring local spatial autocorrelation, a key concept in spatial econometrics. I also worked on WebGeoda, a browser version of Luc Anselin’s desktop GeoDa app, by creating various data analysis widgets for spatial autocorrelation.
