# Rachel Fregly

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project:** Making Machine Learning More Human – Quantifying Parent-Child Language Alignment Using Neural Language Models

**Mentor:** [Allyson Ettinger](https://linguistics.uchicago.edu/allyson-ettinger), Department of Linguistics & [Susan Goldin-Meadow](https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/susan-goldin-meadow), Department of Psychology

**Research Area Keywords:** Computational Linguistics // Natural Language Processing // Data Analysis

**Project Description:**Ray Fregly is a junior at the University of Chicago double majoring in linguistics and computer science. This summer, she worked with Drs. [Allyson Ettinger](https://linguistics.uchicago.edu/allyson-ettinger) and [Susan Goldin-Meadow](https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/susan-goldin-meadow) on a project that altered and implemented neural network language models to Pytorch to quantify parent-child language alignment based on previously collected data. The long-term goal of the project is to use the results of this study to improve our understanding of child language acquisition.
