# John Chodera

Associate Member at Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research

John Chodera is an experienced computational chemist, and an Associate Member at Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research (MSKKC). His research combines the disciplines of statistical mechanics, biomolecular simulation, and biophysical measurements to develop quantitative models for predicting and understanding how small molecules selectively bind biomolecular targets, how binding modulates conformation and function, and how mutations can perturb drug binding affinities to cause drug resistance.

John has authored over 75 articles in peer-reviewed journals, which have collectively received over 12,500 literature citations. John has also received numerous awards including the BIH Einstein Visiting Fellowship, Silicon Therapeutics Open Science Fellowship, Louis V. Gerstner Young Investigator Award, QB3-Berkeley Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship, IBM Predoctoral Fellowship, the Frank M. Goyan Award for outstanding work in Physical Chemistry at UCSF, and a HHMI Predoctoral Fellowship.

John holds a B.S. in Biology from Caltech and a Ph.D. in Biophysics from the University of California, San Francisco. He completed postdoctoral studies at Stanford University and at University of California, Berkeley as a QB3 Fellow.
