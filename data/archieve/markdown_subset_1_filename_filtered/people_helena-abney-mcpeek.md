Undergraduate, Harvard University

**Project: Physical Backdoors in Neural Networks**

**Mentor/Lab:** [Ben Zhao](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/)/[SAND Lab](http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Artificial Intelligence // Machine Learning // Security & Privacy

My project was about detecting physical backdoor attacks in image-detecting neural networks. I added physical triggers to traffic signs (blue tape or sticky notes along the bottom of the sign) and added these images to a training dataset for a neural network that classifies traffic signs. The goal of the project was to find a way to detect that the network had been attacked and mitigate the attack.
