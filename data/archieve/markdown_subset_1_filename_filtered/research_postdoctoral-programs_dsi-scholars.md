* [Description](#description)

  ## Data Science Institute Postdoctoral Scholars Program

  #### [Submit an Application](https://uchicago.infoready4.com/#competitionDetail/1951020)

  The Data Science Institute (DSI) at the University of Chicago invites applications for Postdoctoral Scholars who wish to advance cutting-edge data science approaches, methods, and applications in research. The DSI executes the University of Chicago’s bold, innovative vision of Data Science as a new discipline by advancing foundational and interdisciplinary research, developing partnerships with industry, government, and social impact organizations, and implementing a holistic approach to data science education.

  The DSI is part of a vibrant and growing data science community which includes departments across campus as well as the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Argonne National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC). These on-campus partnerships enable and encourage unique interdisciplinary research partnerships, reducing early-stage friction to hasten meaningful relationships and high-impact research.

  This unique program provides postdocs with the opportunity to pursue original research on significant questions in data science. Drawing on the University of Chicago’s top-ranked programs, world-renowned faculty, as well as a vibrant and quickly expanding data science ecosystem, this program allows postdoctoral scholars to engage in field-defining data science and artificial intelligence research. Our positions carry a competitive salary, generous research funding allowances, and benefits. It is equally important that our postdocs work and grow in an environment that is supportive and focused on community and career development; as such, this program includes lectures focused on communication and workplace culture, and aims to develop a diverse cohort of well-rounded scholars pursuing careers across data science disciplines.

  Postdocs may (but do not need to) choose to express interest in working on one of the DSI’s six research initiatives, [AI+Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/), [Data & Democracy](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/data-democracy/), [Internet Equity](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/)**,** [AI for Climate](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/aice-ai-for-climate/), [Data Ecology](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/data-ecology/), and [Complementary AI](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/complementary-ai/).

  #### **Equal Employment Opportunity Statement:**

  All University departments and institutes are charged with building a faculty from a diversity of backgrounds and with diverse viewpoints; with cultivating an inclusive community that values freedom of expression; and with welcoming and supporting all their members.
