# Data Storytelling for Nonprofits: Ethical & Responsible Data Practices

January 18, 2024 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM

Virtual Event

This interactive workshop will help you explore and assess your organization’s data practices and learn recommendations for improving data collection, management, and storage. We will discuss how to implement robust data practices in accessible, ethical, and equitable ways. Participants will come away with guidelines for a comprehensive understanding of their own data practices, and resources for further learning.

Featured Speaker: [Evelyn Campbell, Preceptor](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/evelyn-campbell/). Evelyn is a preceptor in data science focusing on data science education as a joint instructor for both the University of Chicago and City Colleges of Chicago. She obtained her PhD in Microbiology from the University of Chicago in 2022 and her BS in Biology from Rider University in 2016. She enjoys reading, writing, and talking with friends and family.

This workshop is Session 2 of Data Storytelling for Nonprofits, a three-part workshop series from the Data Science Institute. This series is centered on how nonprofit and social sector organizations can leverage data effectively to tell the stories and impact of their work. These workshops will provide you with resources and tools for assessing your data practice, strategies for meaningfully communicating data, and resources for building further data capacity.

This workshop is open to all nonprofit professionals and social sector leaders interested in building data culture and capacity within their organizations. No previous data science experience is required.
