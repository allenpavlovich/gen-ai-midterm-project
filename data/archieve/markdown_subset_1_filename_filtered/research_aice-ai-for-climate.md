Research Initiative

# AICE: AI for Climate

A program of the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Growth and DSI, AI for Climate aims to accelerate and transform climate research with a focus on both scientific advances and societal impacts.

A joint initiative with:

Climate change, particularly the exacerbation of extreme events, is among the most pressing challenges facing humanity and the scientific community. Effectively addressing climate change requires rapid advances around 1) improving prediction capabilities and understanding of climate physics, 2) developing quantitative models for climate change’s socioeconomic impacts, and 3) creating new climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.

!

The AI for Climate Initiative (AICE) combines the staggering innovations in AI and rapid increase of data availability with fundamental domain knowledge to significantly advance (1)–(3) in a highly synergistic and interdisciplinary fashion. Close collaboration between different disciplines, e.g., climate science, computer science, economics, math, physics, public health, social science, and statistics, is essential to innovate or properly adapt AI methods for developing novel tools, such as physics-informed predictive models, and trustworthy datasets for training or analysis. 

From developing foundation AI climate/weather models to large-language models, AICE aims to synergise and support the UChicago, Argonne National Lab, and Toyota Technological Institute communities and external partners to transform climate research. AICE complements, supports, and closely connects existing initiatives, most notably, the DSI’s [AI+Science Initiative](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/) (led by advisory board member Becca Willett), the Climate and Energy Institute, the [Climate Systems Engineering Initiative](https://climateengineering.uchicago.edu/) (CSEi), the [Innovation Commission](https://innovationcommission.uchicago.edu/) and [Development Innovation Lab](https://dil.uchicago.edu/) (led by advisory board member Michael Kremer), and the [Trillion Parameter Consortium](https://tpc.dev/) for AI+Science (Co-led by Co-PI Ian Foster). 

AICE is currently hiring a Research Scientist. [Click here](https://apply.interfolio.com/159359) to learn more and apply today. EOE / Vet / Disability

I am an associate professor at the Department of Geophysical Sciences and [Committee of Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu/). Before joining UChicago, I was a tenured associate professor at Rice University. I received my Ph.D. (geophysical turbulence) and M.A. (applied mathematics) from UC Berkeley in 2013 and was a Ziff Environmental Fellow at the Harvard University Center for the Environment and Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences from 2013 to 2016. I received a CAREER Award from NSF in 2021 and a Young Investigator Award from the Office of Naval Research in 2020.

I lead the Climate Extremes Theory and Data (C*e*TD) group focused on integrating theory, simulations, observations, and machine learning techniques to understand the dynamics and future changes of extreme weather events in a changing climate.

[Dr. Jiwen Fan](https://www.anl.gov/profile/jiwen-fan) is the Deputy Division Director and Senor Earth Scientist of the Environmental Science Division. She also holds a joint appointment as a senior scientist at University of Chicago. She is a Fellow of American Meteorological Society (AMS).

Dr. Fan’s research encompasses atmospheric chemistry and aerosols, cloud physics, convective systems, severe weather, aerosol-precipitation-climate interactions, land-atmosphere interactions, and human-earth system interactions. Her primary foci in recent years include the impacts of environmental (e.g., urbanization, anthropogenic aerosols, wildfires) and climate change on convective storms and weather hazards and model developments of cloud microphysics and aerosol-cloud interactions.

Pertaining to AICE, she has been working with data scientists to develop machine learning models for predicting precipitation and hail, analyzing observational data, and building ML emulators for complex cloud microphysical processes.

Dr. Ian Foster is Senior Scientist and Distinguished Fellow, and also director of the Data Science and Learning Division, at Argonne National Laboratory, and the Arthur Holly Compton Distinguished Service Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. Ian received a BSc degree from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and a PhD from Imperial College, United Kingdom, both in computer science. His research deals with distributed, parallel, and data-intensive computing technologies, and innovative applications of those technologies to scientific problems in such domains as materials science, climate change, and biomedicine. Foster is a fellow of the AAAS, ACM, BCS, and IEEE, and an Office of Science Distinguished Scientists Fellow.

In his research,  he seeks to develop tools and techniques that allow people to use high-performance computing technologies to do qualitatively new things. This involves investigations of parallel and distributed languages, algorithms, and communication; and also focused work on applications. He is particularly interested in using high-performance networking to incorporate remote compute and information resources into local computational environments.

[Prof. Shaw](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~tas1/)’s research focuses on the physics of the atmosphere and climate system past, present and future. She seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms controlling the response to climate changes so that we can have greater confidence in future projections. Her approach combines theory (primarily conservation laws), numerical modeling across a hierarchy of complexity and observational data analysis. Prof. Shaw is excited to take advantage of AI/ML tools for increasing our understanding and prediction of the impacts of climate change. She is working to ensure these methods get the right answer for the right reasons.
