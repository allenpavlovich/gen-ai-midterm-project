Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Mentor:**[Ravi Madduri](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ravi-k-madduri)

**Project Title:**Machine Learning Mobile Applications for Health Promotion

**Project Description:**This summer, alongside fellow cohort member Daniel Chechelnitsky, she worked with Dr. Ravi Madduri to create a mobile health app implementing machine learning models of disease prediction. Using Flutter, an open-source UI software development kit launched by Google, she designed and implemented the front-end and back-end components of the application, working with SQL databases and TensorFlowLite machine learning models among other things. The code for the final product can be found [here](https://github.com/chechelnitskd/prostate_predict).
