# Daniel Chechelnitsky

Undergraduate, Macalester College

**Mentor:**[Ravi Madduri](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ravi-k-madduri)

**Project Title:**Exploring Machine Learning Applications in Mobile Health Development

**Project Description:**Mobile apps have real potential in helping individuals understand their risks for various diseases and help make better choices to lower their risks. Using Flutter, we developed a navigable and scalable mobile app environment, decided on UI/UX design of the app, implemented a static risk calculator (prostate cancer) and a image classification ML model (skin cancer). We also tried building and training our own regression models, but we were not able to deploy them in the Flutter framework.
