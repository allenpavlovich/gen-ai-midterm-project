  * [Are letters of recommendation required?](#accordion-tab-3) 

    We do not require letters of recommendation, but you may submit an optional letter of recommendation for the Summer Lab application. The letter can come from a teacher, a coach, employer, or mentor and should speak to your enthusiasm about learning, research, and/or community. The recommender must submit their letter through a form; the letter submission form is linked in the Summer Lab application. Letters are due at the same time as Summer Lab applications: January 12 at 11:59 CT.
* [Eligibility](#)

  * [Are there any program prerequisites?](#accordion-tab-0) 

    We do not require any previous research experience to participate in the program. Familiarity in at least one programming language (Python, Java, C++, etc.) is preferred, as well as relevant coursework in areas such as computer science, statistics, and math.
  * [What grade or age of students are eligible to apply?](#accordion-tab-1) 

    Applicants may be in high school or college.

    High school applicants must be located in the Chicago area and must be able to comfortably commute to the UChicago Hyde Park campus. Undergraduate applicants must be enrolled in college in fall 2025 (graduating college seniors are not eligible). Current high school seniors who will be starting college in fall 2025 will be categorized as high school applicants and therefore must be located in the Chicago area. Graduate students are not eligible.
  * [Are international students eligible to apply?](#accordion-tab-2) 

    Yes, international undergraduate students are eligible to apply. However, all students must be authorized to work in the United States and provide all necessary documentation in support of their stipend. To see the documentation required to process stipends, please consult [this page](https://finserv.uchicago.edu/payroll/department/stipend.shtml). We recommend that all international students check with their home institution’s international affairs office to ensure that they qualify.

  * [If admitted, how will I be paired with a project?](#accordion-tab-1) 

    During the application review process, we use your written statements, experience, and research keywords to match applicants with mentors and projects based on shared interests. We aim to build a cohort with a variety of levels of experience with research and data science.

    Admitted students will be informed of their mentor and project match at the time of admission notification.
