# Rina Foygel Barber

Louis Block Professor, Department of Statistics and the College; Co-chair, Committee on Community, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (CCEDI)

My research interests are in developing and analyzing estimation, inference, and optimization tools for structured high-dimensional data problems such as sparse regression, sparse nonparametric models, and low-rank models. I work on developing methods for false discovery rate control in settings where we may have undersampled data or misspecified models, and for distribution-free inference in settings where the data distribution is unknown. I also collaborate on modeling and optimization problems in image reconstruction for medical imaging.
