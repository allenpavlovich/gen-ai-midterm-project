**Why Data Science?**  
As an emerging discipline, **Data Science** seeks to address foundational problems  
across the globe. Tackling issues of inequity, climate change, and disinformation will  
require cutting edge research in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data  
systems. It also requires innovative educational programs that train students to think  
critically about a data-driven society and these unique challenges posed to us all.  
Students at the University of Chicago can expect an education that interconnects critical  
technical skills in data science, in collaboration with award-winning faculty and  
researchers, along with opportunities for advanced research across multiple specialties.  
Here, you will not only immerse yourself in a rapidly evolving field; you will help redefine  
it altogether.
