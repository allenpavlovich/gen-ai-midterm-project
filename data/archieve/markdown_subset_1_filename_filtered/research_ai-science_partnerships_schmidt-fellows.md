# The Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship, a Program of Schmidt Sciences

Training scholars who seek to advance and accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the natural sciences

[The Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://aiscience.uchicago.edu/), a program of Schmidt Sciences, at the University of Chicago trains scholars who seek to advance and accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the natural sciences. The rise of AI in science and engineering presents both a remarkable opportunity and a profound challenge to human-centered modes of inquiry, including not only data analysis, but also the design of experiments, the formulation of new hypotheses, and the revelation of natural laws. Given the cross-disciplinary nature of AI research in science, Fellows are offered freedom and independence in pursuing their disciplinary research integrating AI methods, including the flexibility to change or expand their research focus and to work with multiple research groups while at the University.

This unique program is part of an engaged, cross-disciplinary AI and science community that includes departments across the UChicago campus as well as Argonne National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and the Marine Biological Laboratory.

Fellows have the opportunity to pursue original research on significant questions in AI and science. They form a cohort of top scholars across the natural sciences engaging in joint training and research activities. Fellows receive the training in AI methods necessary for conducting their research. Drawing on the University’s top-ranked programs, world-renowned faculty, and vibrant data science ecosystem, this program allows postdoctoral fellows to engage in field- defining research.
