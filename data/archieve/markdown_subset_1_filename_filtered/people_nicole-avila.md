**Project Title:**AWS Spot Market Trends from 2018 and 2021

**Project Description:** In late 2017, Amazon changed the spot market algorithm with the aim of decreasing price variability, increasing spot instance durability, and regularizing the market (Baughman et al, 2019). These changes have made it impossible to rely on the previous strategy of using supply and demand to make decisions. Our research looks at 2021 spot market prices and comparing them to 2018 and compare findings to results found in Deconstructing the 2017 Changes to AWS Spot Market.
