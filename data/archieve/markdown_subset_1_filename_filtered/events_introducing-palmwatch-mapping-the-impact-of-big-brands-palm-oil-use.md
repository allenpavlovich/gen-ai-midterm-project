# Introducing PalmWatch: Mapping the impact of big brands’ palm oil use

February 22, 2024 7:00 AM – 8:30 AM

Zoom Virtual Conference

!

Inclusive Development International and the Data Science Institute at the University of Chicago are launching PalmWatch, a new open-access tool that uses advanced data science and open-source intelligence techniques to create a uniquely comprehensive and detailed picture of global palm oil supply chains.

PalmWatch uses novel methods to scrape the web for the most up-to-date information on which palm oil mills major brands source from, and to more precisely identify the cultivation areas supplying those individual mills. The tool allows users to link the biggest users of palm oil, such as Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever, to the ground-level impacts of their palm oil consumption, including hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of deforestation.

Speakers will include: — Dustin Roasa, Research Director at Inclusive Development International (IDI) — David Uminsky, Executive Director of the Data Science Institute at the University of Chicago (DSI) — Syahrul Fitra, Senior Forest Campaigner at Greenpeace Southeast Asia (Greenpeace SEA) NOTE: The event will be held in English with simultaneous interpretation into Bahasa Indonesia.
