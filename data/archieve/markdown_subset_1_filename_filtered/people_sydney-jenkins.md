**Project: [Is Climate Change Changing Clouds?](/research/is-climate-change-changing-clouds/)**

**Mentors/Lab:** [Ian Foster](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/ian-foster/), [Michael Maire](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/michael-maire/), [Elisabeth Moyer](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~moyer/MoyerWebsite/Home%20Page/HomePage.html), [Rebecca Willett](https://voices.uchicago.edu/willett/)/[RDCEP](http://www.rdcep.org/people)

**Research Area Keywords:** Biology & Environment // Image Analysis // Machine Learning

I helped develop a machine learning algorithm for identifying different cloud classes based on satellite images. We hope to use our model to better understand trends in cloud cover, which plays a critical role in climate change.

*Project News:* Two papers arose from this research, and both were accepted to the American Geophysical Union Fall 2019 meeting: “[Cloud Characterization With Deep Learning II](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/492604)” and “[Developing Unsupervised Learning Models for Cloud Classification](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/612555).”
