**Project Title:**SPOKES: an End-to-End Simulation Facility for Spectroscopic Cosmological Surveys

**Project Description:**I worked under Brian D. Nord, an astrophysicist and machine learning researcher at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, on an open-source Python package providing an end-to-end simulation facility for spectroscopic cosmological surveys called SPOKES. SPOKES is built upon an integrated infrastructure, modular functioning organization, coherent data handling, and fast data access. SPOKES is published on PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/spokes/.
