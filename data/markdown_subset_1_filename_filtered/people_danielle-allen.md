**Mentors:**Daniel Grzenda & [David Uminsky](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-uminsky/)

**Project Title:**Social Impact Track – Schmidt Ocean Institute, ROV Dive Processing

**Project Description:**The Schmidt Ocean Institute uses a remote operated robot to collect video footage of the ocean but needed ways to efficiently parse through this video. Our team developed deep learning unsupervised models to create highlight reels of the robot dives. We also used various machine learning techniques to create tags for notable aspects of the videos.
