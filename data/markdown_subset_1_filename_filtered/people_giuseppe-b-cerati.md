# Giuseppe B. Cerati

Associate Scientist, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory

Since joining Fermilab in 2016, my scientific work has focused on the search of new physics in neutrino oscillation experiments.

As a member of the MicroBooNE Collaboration (since 2016), I am mainly interested in searching for sterile neutrinos, as well as in the development of techniques for the reconstruction and analysis of Liquid Argon Time Project Chambers data. I also joined the DUNE Collaboration, where my main interest is CP violation in the neutrino sector.

Previously I worked for about a decade on the CMS experiments, with major contributions to the Higgs boson discovery, SUSY searches and Standard Model measurements.

I served as CMS Track Reconstruction convener in 2013-2014.
