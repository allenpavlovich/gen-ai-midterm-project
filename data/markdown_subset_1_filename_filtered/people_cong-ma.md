Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics

I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, advised by Professor [Martin Wainwright](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/). I obtained my Ph.D. at Princeton University in 2020, advised by Professor [Yuxin Chen](http://www.princeton.edu/~yc5/) and Professor [Jianqing Fan](https://orfe.princeton.edu/~jqfan/). Prior to graduate school, I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2015.

I am broadly interested in mathematics of data science, reinforcement learning, high-dimensional statistics, convex and nonconvex optimization as well as their applications to neuroscience.
