# Summer Lab Presents: Data & Democracy, From the Experts

July 26, 2022 4:30 PM – 6:30 PM

Keller Center

Leveraging data science is essential to understanding—and developing innovative solutions to—the challenges facing democracy in the digital age. Through a partnership between the Data Science Institute and Center for Effective Government, UChicago’s Data & Democracy initiative is bringing together world-class talent from scholars across academic disciplines and practitioners on the front lines of our democracy to advance this important work. Join us on **July 26th at 4:30pm CT** as we explore the critical role of data science through the eyes and work of these experts, from understanding and predicting bias in political messaging, to safeguarding our elections, to combatting online influence operations of extremists and states.

After short presentations from speakers profiling their work, the panel will come together to discuss the connections between their work, the importance of data science in their fields, and the trajectory of their careers. A networking reception will follow in the Keller Center Lobby and Commons.

Speakers include:

**Ben Dubow** (President and Chief Technology Officer, [Omelas](https://www.omelas.io/#1))

**Tiana Epps-Johnson** (Founder and Executive Director, [Center for Tech and Civic Life](https://www.techandciviclife.org/) | 2022 Senior Practitioner Fellow, University of Chicago Center for Effective Government)

**Daniel Grzenda** (Staff Data Scientist, University of Chicago Data Science Institute | Research Grantee, Data & Democracy)

**Yuan Chang (YC) Leong** (Assistant Professor, University of Chicago Department of Psychology | Research Grantee, Data & Democracy)

This event is co-sponsored by the Data Science Institute and the University of Chicago’s [Computational Analysis and Public Policy program](https://capp.uchicago.edu/).
