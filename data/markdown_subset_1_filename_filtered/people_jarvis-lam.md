# Jarvis Lam

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project: EMS Gesture Classification**

**Mentor/Lab:** [Heather Zheng](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~htzheng/)/[SAND Lab](http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Artificial Intelligence // Human-Computer Interaction // Machine Learning // Security & Privacy

I helped build a gesture classification model that classifies 32 different hand gestures generated by electrical muscle stimulation. In doing so, our lab hopes to develop novel and secure human-computer interaction methods and secure communication techniques.
