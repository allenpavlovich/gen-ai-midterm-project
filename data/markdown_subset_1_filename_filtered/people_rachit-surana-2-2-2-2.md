# Svitlana Midianko

Undergraduate, Minerva Schools at KGI

**Project:**Optimizing Thermal Dissipation of 3D-Printed Objects

**Mentor:** [Pedro Lopes](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/pedro-lopes/), [Human-Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Human-Computer Interaction // Wearables & Devices

**Project Description:**Svitlana Midianko is a junior at the Minerva Schools at KGI studying human behavior. This summer, she worked with [Prof. Pedro Lopes](http://plopes.org/) in the [Human Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/) on a project centered around optimizing thermal dissipation of 3-D printed objects. The project included the development of the Fusion360 plugin, written in Python. With the help of such plugin, makers can optimize the heat dissipation of their hardware without having much knowledge in heat dynamics. The plugin’s execution results in modification of the device’s design, explicitly adding extra holes in the upper case. Such change is optimized for minimum temperature of the device.
