# Data Science Clinic

An experiential course where students work with clients on real-world data science projects with support from UChicago faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and research staff.

Industry Affiliates participate in the Data Science Clinic. Students work in teams with real-world datasets to apply models and algorithms to data, navigate security and privacy issues, communicate actionable insights to diverse stakeholders, and even produce deliverables such as open-source software.

**!**In addition to giving students a window into data science careers, these [unique collaborations](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/data-science-clinic-students-solve-real-world-problems-gain-lifelong-skills/) allow industry partners to identify top student talent, all while supplementing their internal data science teams with additional support and enlarging their capacity to experiment with new ideas.

Projects are tailored and scoped to address company objectives with all deliverables overseen by the Clinic Director. *As needed, mentors and students will sign a non-disclosure agreement at the company’s request. All IP generated by the project is retained by the Clinic partner.*
