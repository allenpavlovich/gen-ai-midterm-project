# Improving Batteries to Combat Climate Change

Establishing a fully automated, research-grade platform for the assembly and evaluation of batteries by integrating AI-driven models for predicting electrolyte properties with a high-throughput (HT) robotic system for battery construction.

Decarbonization efforts necessary for addressing climate change are increasingly reliant on energy storage solutions, notably rechargeable batteries. The progression towards advanced battery technology, however, is hindered by traditional trial-and-error approaches in materials discovery. 

Postdoctoral Fellow [Ritesh Kumar](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/ritesh-kumar/), along with Assistant Professor [Chibueze Amanchukwu](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/chibueze-amanchukwu/), are addressing this issue by integrating AI models to establish a fully automated, research grade platform for the assembly and evaluation of batteries, focusing on the exploration of new liquid electrolytes compatible with next-generation battery chemistries. This platform will enable the accelerated fabrication and assessment of batteries formulated with AI-predicted electrolyte candidates, examining their performance. The initiative is poised to revolutionize the methodology of battery materials discovery, significantly expediting the advent of superior next-generation batteries on a global scale. The improved battery technology produced by this project will be crucial in combating climate change.
