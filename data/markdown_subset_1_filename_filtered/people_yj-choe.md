People / Post-Doctoral Scholars

# Yo Joong “YJ” Choe

Postdoctoral Scholar, Data Science Institute

Yo Joong “YJ” Choe joined DSI as a Postdoctoral Scholar in September 2023. He received his Ph.D. in Statistics and Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University. YJ is broadly interested in evaluating and understanding modern machine learning predictors, including black-box classifiers, sequential forecasters, and large language models. He currently focuses on two research directions: (1) leveraging modern statistical methodology, such as game-theoretic statistics, anytime-valid inference, and causal inference, for rigorously evaluating black-box predictors; and (2) understanding and interpreting large language models, including their embedding spaces. During a hiatus from his Ph.D. program, he worked as a Research Scientist at Kakao Brain and Kakao, specializing in deep learning and natural language processing. YJ holds an M.S. in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University and a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Chicago.
