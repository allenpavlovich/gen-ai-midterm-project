# Julia Mendelsohn

Postdoctoral Scholar, Data Science Institute

Julia Mendelsohn does research at the intersection of language, politics, and computation. She is particularly interested in computationally modeling subtle rhetoric in online political discussions, and understanding the social, political and technological implications of such language. Julia has published papers at top-tier natural language processing and computational social science venues, including ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, and ICWSM, where she received the Outstanding Methodology award in 2023. She was supported by a Google PhD Fellowship, recognized as a finalist for the Twitch and Meta PhD Fellowships, and awarded an Honorable Mention from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. Julia completed her PhD in Information at the University of Michigan, and received a BA in Linguistics and an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University.
