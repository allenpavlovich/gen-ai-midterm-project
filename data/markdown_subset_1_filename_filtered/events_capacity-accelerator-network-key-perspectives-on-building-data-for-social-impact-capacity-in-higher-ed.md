# Capacity Accelerator Network: ‘Key Perspectives on Building Data for Social Impact Capacity in Higher Ed’

December 14, 2023 9:00 AM – 11:00 AM

Dr. Mario Banuelos of Fresno State, Kate Connor of City Colleges of Chicago, Dr. David Uminsky of the University of Chicago, and Dr. Amy Yeboah Quarkume of Howard University will join data.org’s Priyank Hirani to reflect on learnings from the two-year Data Capacity Accelerator. Join us to hear from university faculty on the frontier of building data for social impact in higher education on topics including developing DSI and experiential learning programs, applying a social justice and financial inclusion lens to DSI training, building a playbook for creating experiential data science curricula, and the critical underpinning of IDEA in their work.
