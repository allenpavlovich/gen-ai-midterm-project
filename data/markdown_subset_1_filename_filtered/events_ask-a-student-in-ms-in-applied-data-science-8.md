The [MS in Applied Data Science,](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) “Ask a Student” series allows prospective students the opportunity to meet virtually with current students in the MS in Applied Data Science program. Are you curious about life as a student in the University of Chicago’s MS in Applied Data Science program? Do you have burning questions about coursework, projects, or the overall student experience? Well, you’re in luck! We’re thrilled to announce our upcoming virtual event, “Ask a Student,” where you can get all your queries answered.

**Presenter Bio**: Gretchen Forbush is a student in the part-time online MSADS program wrapping up her third term (three to go!). She has been a full-time data scientist for 3.5 years at IBM in their federal consulting division working on and leading projects for the government using skills like machine learning, NLP, and computer vision. As an undergraduate major in computer science and math, Gretchen applied to the MS-ADS program with the hopes of establishing a better foundation of data science skills and best practices that she didn’t already have, and UChicago has provided that and more. In her free time, Gretchen loves to be active, read, knit, and cook. She currently lives in Arlington, VA but loves traveling to Chicago to meet with her peers during the twice-yearly immersion weekends.
