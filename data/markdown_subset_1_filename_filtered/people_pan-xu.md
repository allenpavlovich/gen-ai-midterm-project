**Talk Abstract:**Optimization lies at the heart of modern machine learning and data science research. How to design data-efficient optimization algorithms that have a low sample complexity while enjoying a fast convergence at the same time has remained a challenging but imperative topic in machine learning. My research aims to answer this question from two facets: providing the theoretical analysis and understanding of optimization algorithms; and developing new algorithms with strong empirical performance in a principled way. In this talk, I will introduce our recent work in developing and improving data-efficient optimization algorithms for decision-making (reinforcement learning) problems. In particular, I will introduce the variance reduction technique in optimization and show how it can improve the data efficiency of policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning. I will present the variance reduced policy gradient algorithm, which constructs an unbiased policy gradient estimator for the value function. I will show that it provably reduces the sample complexity of vanilla policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GPOMDP.
