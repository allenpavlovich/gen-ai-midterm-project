Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project: Enhancing Breathability of Wearable Devices**

**Mentor/Lab:** [Pedro Lopes](http://plopes.org/)/[HCI Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Human-Computer Interaction // Wearable Devices

My project was to improve the breathability of wearable devices that capture biometric data, such as Apple watches and Fitbits, by creating silicone interfaces that can be slotted between the skin and a wearable. The aim for the silicone interface is to pipe out sweat and allow trapped heat to escape, improving user comfort. I experimented with manufacturing techniques and principles of microfluidics to design a process that can be used by hobbyists who only have access to machinery typically found in a makerspace.
