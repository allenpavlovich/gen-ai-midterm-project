# Chinmaya Mahesh

Undergraduate, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

**Project:**Self-Driving Trigger For Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Data

**Mentors:** [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen.org/) & [David Miller](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-miller/), Department of Computer Science & Department of Physics

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning & AI // Physics & Astronomy

**Project Description:**Chinmaya Mahesh is a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in computer science. This summer, he worked with Drs. [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen.org/) and [David Miller](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-miller/) on a CDAC Discovery Grant research project titled, “[A Data-Driven Trigger System for the Large Hadron Collider](/research/a-data-driven-trigger-system-for-the-large-hadron-collider/).” The project aims to build a machine learning powered replacement for the current trigger system. The main goal of this project was to finish the first step, which is to build an explainable AI model which can interpret and explain in a cost effective way the decisions of a machine learning based trigger system.
