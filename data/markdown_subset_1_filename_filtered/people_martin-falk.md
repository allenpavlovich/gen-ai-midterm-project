# Martin Falk

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

The goal of Martin Falk’s research is to create next-generation materials which can compute, morph, and continually adapt to their environments. However, identifying the rare designs that lead to such unusual behaviors requires searching through a combinatorially large number of fabrication and control protocols. To find these rare designs, Falk will draw on techniques from computer vision and active learning, developing AI agents capable of autonomous search and rigorous scientific discovery in novel material platforms.

**BIO**:

Martin Falk initially joined the University of Chicago in 2019 to work with Prof. Arvind Murugan as a postdoc in a MRSEC initiative focused on the creation of trainable materials. Prior, Falk’s Ph.D. was supervised in the MIT Physics department by Profs. Michael Brenner and Leonid Mirny on problems in polymer self-assembly. Falk received a B.A. in Math and Physics from the University of Pennsylvania in 2014, where Falk was advised by Profs. Tom Lubensky and Joe Subotnik.
