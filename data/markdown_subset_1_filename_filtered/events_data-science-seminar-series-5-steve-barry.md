**Title:** Data Science for Robotics in the Era of MultiModal Models

In this presentation, [Steve Barry](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/stephen-barry/), an instructor at UChicago’s ADSP and Head of Data Science and AI at Savant Wealth Management, explores the integration of traditional data science approaches with multimodal models in robotics. He will discuss how these combined methodologies enhance robotic functionalities and enable sophisticated human-robot interactions across various sectors. By highlighting current case studies and contrasting them with traditional methods, Steve will delve into how established data science techniques complement modern AI to improve perception, decision-making, and interaction in robotics. The talk will also address challenges, ethical considerations, and regulatory frameworks related to the deployment of these technologies, focusing on issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, data security, and the impact on employment.
