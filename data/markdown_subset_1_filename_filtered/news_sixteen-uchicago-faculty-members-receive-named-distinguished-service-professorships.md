# Sixteen UChicago faculty members receive named, distinguished service professorships

Including DSI's very own Michael Franklin and Dan Nicolae

Sixteen University of Chicago faculty members have received distinguished service professorships or named professorships.

Profs. Michael Franklin, Chang-Tai Hsieh, Dan Nicolae, Lubos Pastor, Robert Shimer and Lisa Wedeen have been named distinguished service professors. Profs. Scott Ashworth, Orit Bashkin, William Baude, Sarah Hammerschlag, Julia R. Henly, William Hubbard, Jonathan Lyon, Jennifer Nou, C. Riley Snorton and Tara Zahra have received named professorships.

All appointments were effective July 1, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

## Division of the Humanities

**Orit Bashkin** has been named the Mabel Greene Myers Professor in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and the College.

As a historian specializing on the intellectual, social and cultural history of the modern Middle East, Bashkin delves into Iraqi history, the history of Iraqi Jews, the Arab cultural revival movement in the late 19th-century, and the connections between modern Arab history and Arabic literature. Her most recent books include the edited volume “Jews and Journeys: Travel and Performance of Jewish Identity” (2021), which was co-authored with Joshua Levinson; and “Impossible Exodus: Iraqi Jews in Israel” (2017), which received the 2018 Nikki Keddie Book Award from the Middle East Studies Association.

Recently, Bashkin received a Guggenheim Fellowship to support a book project on the history of Middle Eastern Jews from the early-modern to modern period. Drawing from Arabic, Judeo-Arabic and Hebrew sources, she will show how Jews remembered and understood Ottoman and Arab politics through contemporary and biblical narratives. Through her scholarship, Bashkin has excelled at discovering lesser-known communities in the Middle East and describing their remarkable histories.

**C. Riley Snorton** has been named the Mary R. Morton Professor in the Departments of English Language and Literature, of Race, Diaspora and Indigeneity, and the College.

A Black and transgender cultural theorist, his research draws from Black studies, queer theory and trans theory, seeking to complicate and expand those histories through the creation of a new vocabulary. His award-winning book “Black on Both Sides: A Racial History of Trans Identity” (2017) was the first publication to weave together the study of race and transgender identity, exploring those intersections from the 19th century to the present. Among the book’s awards are the William Sanders Scarborough Prize from the Modern Language Association, the John Boswell Prize from the American Historical Association, the Lamba Literary Award for Transgender Nonfiction and the Sylvia Rivera Award in Transgender Studies from the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies.

Snorton’s first book “Nobody Is Supposed to Know” (2014) examines how negative perceptions of Black sexuality are reinforced by media and pop culture portrayals of the “down low”—Black men who have sex with men without identifying as gay, queer or bisexual. His next monograph, tentatively titled “Mud: Ecologies of Racial Meaning,” looks at the pervasive presence of swamps to racial practices and formations in the Americas. He is the co-editor of GLQ: A Journal of Gay and Lesbian Studies.

## Physical Sciences Division

**Michael Franklin** has been named the Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the College.

An authority on databases, data analytics, data management and distributed systems, Franklin serves as the Liew Family Chair of the Computer Science Department and also as Senior Advisor to the Provost on Computation and Data Science, and is the faculty co-director of the Data Science Institute.

Under his leadership, the Department of Computer Science has undergone a rapid expansion in scope and stature, building world-leading research efforts in many areas including human-computer interaction, data science, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and quantum computing and growing computer science into one of the most popular majors in the College.

Franklin is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

**Dan Nicolae** has been named the Elaine M. and Samuel D. Kersten, Jr. Distinguished Service Professor in the Departments of Statistics and Medicine and the College.

Nicolae’s research seeks to understand the role of genetic, genomic and environmental factors, and their interactions, in the development of common diseases. A statistical geneticist and a mathematical statistician, he specializes in developing methodological advances for large data problems in biology and medicine. Particular interests include functional genomics, microbiome, integration of omics data, networks, and systems biology. The innovative statistical and computational methods developed by his group are based on foundations in high-dimensional statistical inference, machine learning and data science.

Nicolae has authored more than 150 papers, with the impact of his work recognized extensively including a best paper award from the International Genetic Epidemiology Society. Nicolae joined the faculty at the University of Chicago in 1999. He has served as chair of the Department of Statistics from 2016-2022, section chief for the Section of Genetic Medicine from 2015-2016, and currently as faculty co-director of the Data Science Institute.

## Division of the Social Sciences

**Jonathan Lyon** has been named the inaugural Sorin and Imran Siddiqui Professor in the Department of History and the College.

He has served as director of the Social Science Teaching Fellowship Program and multiple terms as chair of the European Civilization Sequence. In 2021, Lyon received the highest teaching honor that the University bestows in the Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Education.

**Robert Shimer** has been named the George J. Stigler Distinguished Service Professor in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics and the College.

A leading macroeconomist best known for his work in labor markets, Shimer’s contributions to the field of economics have been recognized by a number of significant honors, including the Sherwin Rosen Prize for outstanding contributions in the field of Labor Economics, awarded by the Society of Labor Economists. A UChicago faculty member since 2003, he is a fellow of the Econometric Society and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In addition to his many contributions as a scholar, Shimer has served as chair of the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics since 2018.

**Lisa Wedeen** has been named the Mary R. Morton Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Political Science and the College.

Working at the intersection of comparative politics, political theory and anthropology, Wedeen writes theoretically motivated and ethnographically informed work about authoritarian regimes, Middle East politics, and interpretative methods, with an enduring focus on the workings of ideology in authoritarian regimes and beyond.

The author of three critically acclaimed books, Wedeen has been instrumental in bringing the rigorous practice of interpretive methods into conversation with mainstream political science. Her recent book, “Authoritarian Apprehensions: Ideology, Judgment, and Mourning in Syria” (2019), received four prestigious awards, including the Gordon J. Laing Award. She is also director of the Chicago Center for Contemporary Theory (3CT), a vibrant site for conferences, workshops, and seminars that draws students and faculty from across the social sciences and the humanities.

**Tara Zahra** has been named the Hanna Holborn Gray Professor in the Department of History and the College.
