# Dimitriy Leksanov

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project:**Distance Matters

**Mentors:** [Eamon Duede](https://eamonduede.com/), [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Data Analysis // Spatial Data // Scientific Computing

**Project** **Description:** Dimitriy Leksanov is a junior at the University of Chicago studying computational and applied mathematics (CAM) and economics. This summer, he worked with [Eamon Duede](https://eamonduede.com/) in the [KnowledgeLab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) on a project exploring how various dimensions of distance affect the influence that one academic’s work has on another. These include physical distance, cultural distance, temporal distance, and distance by knowledge practice. The project explored the latter by using word embedding models to calculate the similarities between different academic papers.
