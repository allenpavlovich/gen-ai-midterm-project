# AI & Science Summer School 2023

July 17 – 21, 2023

Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation

!                                      !

Modern artificial intelligence and machine learning will fundamentally change scientific discovery. We are just beginning to understand the possibilities presented by an era of extraordinarily powerful computers coupled with advanced instruments capable of collecting enormous volumes of high-resolution experimental data. Off-the-shelf machine learning tools cannot fully extract the knowledge contained in these datasets, let alone generate new theories and propose future experiments.

The [AI + Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/) Summer School will be held from **July 17th – 21st**, jointly hosted by the [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.uchicago.edu) (DSI), the [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/) (IMSI) at the University of Chicago, and [Schmidt Futures](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/) via our [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellowship program](http://aiscience.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago.

This year’s speakers will focus on applications of AI and Machine learning in core areas of domain science – materials and chemistry, physics, climate change and biology. The goal of the program is to introduce a new generation of diverse interdisciplinary graduate students and researchers to the emerging field of AI + Science. We also hope this program can build community and spur new research directions focused on AI-enabled scientific discovery across the physical and biological sciences.
