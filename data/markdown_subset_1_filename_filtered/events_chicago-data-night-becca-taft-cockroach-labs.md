# Chicago Data Night: Becca Taft (Cockroach Labs)

CockroachDB: The Resilient Geo-Distributed SQL Database

February 19, 2025 5:30 PM – 7:30 PM

Drive Capital, 215 N Peoria Street

Please join us for our monthly **Chicago Data Night**, cohosted by **[Drive Capital](https://www.drivecapital.com/)**, **[ChiData](https://uchi-db.github.io/chidatasite/)**and the**[DSI](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/)**. Practitioners, academics, and aficionados within the Chicago area are all invited to be part of a community at the intersection of industry and academia, brought together by a mutual interest in data. Each month, guest speakers will cover a specific data-related topic.

*Hors d’oeuvres and drinks will be provided. Admission is free, and we strongly encourage an [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/chicago-data-night/events/305977154/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=share-btn_savedevents_share_modal&utm_source=link) to attend. **Please note our new event location at Drive Capital!***

**Abstract:** We live in an increasingly interconnected world, with many organizations operating across countries or even continents. To serve their global user base, organizations are replacing their legacy DBMSs with cloud-based systems capable of scaling OLTP workloads to millions of users. CockroachDB is a scalable SQL DBMS that was built from the ground up to support these global OLTP workloads while maintaining high availability and strong consistency. Just like its namesake, CockroachDB is resilient to disasters through replication and automatic recovery mechanisms.

In this talk, I’ll give an overview of the architecture of CockroachDB and its novel transaction model that supports consistent geo-distributed transactions without the use of specialized hardware. I will describe how CockroachDB replicates and distributes data to achieve fault tolerance and high performance, as well as how its distributed SQL layer automatically scales with the size of the database cluster while providing the standard SQL interface that users expect. I’ll share some of the work we’ve done to improve the experience of users building applications on CockroachDB that span multiple geographic regions. Finally, I’ll describe our recent efforts to “meet customers where they are” by building features to ease migration of legacy applications to CockroachDB and reduce cost-to-serve.

**!Bio: Becca is a Senior Engineering Manager at Cockroach Labs.** During her 7+ years at the company, she helped build the cost-based query optimizer from scratch and added support for features such as geospatial indexing and locality-optimized search in multi-region clusters. Prior to joining Cockroach Labs, she was a graduate student at MIT, where she worked with Professor Michael Stonebraker researching distributed database elasticity and multi-tenancy.  Becca holds a B.S. in Physics from Yale University and an M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT. Outside of work, she enjoys rowing on the Chicago river and exploring the city with her husband and 18-month-old son.
