# Aaron J. Elmore

Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science

Aaron J. Elmore is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science, and the College of the University of Chicago. Aaron was previously a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT working with Mike Stonebraker on elastic and multitenant database systems, and Sam Madden on the DataHub project. Aaron’s thesis on *Elasticity Primitives for Database-as-a-Service* was completed at the University of California, Santa Barbara under the supervision of Divy Agrawal and Amr El Abbadi. Prior to receiving a PhD, Aaron spent several years in industry and completed an MS at the University of Chicago. His recent research interests focus on building data systems that address the growing data deluge. This includes building a resource-efficent database system (CrocodileDB), new compression techniques for databases (DenseStore and EdgeTSD), bringing git-like functionality to Databases (Datahub, Decible, and OrpheusDB), and data discovery (DataSwamp and Relic). His previous projects included seminal work on polystores (BigDAWG), elastic databases (E-Store), and database migration (Squall and Zephyr).
