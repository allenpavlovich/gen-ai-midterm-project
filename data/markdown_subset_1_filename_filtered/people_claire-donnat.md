# Claire Donnat

Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics

I completed my PhD in Statistics in June 2020 at Stanford University, where I was lucky to be supervised by Professor [Susan Holmes](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html) and where I had the chance to work with [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/). Prior to Stanford, I studied Applied Mathematics and Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique (France), where I received an M.S and B.S equivalent.

My research interests lie in the analysis of patterns and the quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional datasets, and in particular, graphs and networks, geared towards biomedical applications.
