# Huanqiu Zhang

Postdoctoral Scholar, Data Science Institute and Neurobiology Department

I am Huanqiu Zhang, currently a postdoc in the neurobiology department of UChicago. I received my bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and Physiology & Neuroscience from UC San Diego, where I later finished my PhD in Neuroscience. As a graduate student, I studied the neuronal code underlying sensory responses using tools from information theory, differential geometry, topology, etc. Moving to UChicago, my research focuses on characterizing the geometry of neuronal representations, understanding its similarity and difference to that of the artificial neural networks trained on similar tasks, and investigating theoretically how those could affect the behavioral performance of the animals in laboratory settings.
