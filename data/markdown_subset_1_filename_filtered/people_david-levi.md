# Alex Levi

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project:**Combating Misinformation On Twitter Using NLP and Graph Structures

**Mentors:** [Nick Feamster](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/), Department of Computer Science/Center for Data & Computing

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning & AI // Internet of Things

**Project Description:**Alex Levi is a student at the University of Chicago pursuing a joint BA/MS program, majoring in the College in mathematics and beginning his first year in the Masters in Computational Social Science (MACSS) program. This summer, he worked with [Prof. Nick Feamster](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/) on a project focused on building software that detects linkage structures of misinformation on Twitter. Using NLP semantics and network analysis, he built the groundwork for an algorithm that will be able to detect information divergence, both semantically and structurally. He hopes to continue developing this algorithm in the future.
