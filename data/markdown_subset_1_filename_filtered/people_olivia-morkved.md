# Olivia Morkved

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project: “If This Then That” — Generating Predictive Rules for Smart Devices Based on Human Behavior**

**Mentor/Lab:** [Dr. Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/index.htm) & [Weijia He (PhD Candidate, CS)](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/members.html)/[SUPERGroup](https://super.cs.uchicago.edu/)

**Research Area Keywords:** Human-Computer Interaction // Internet of Things

I programmed features into the backend of an IoT application using a Django web framework. I helped a team of IoT researchers collect data using this app on participants’ interactions with smart devices. Our team is working on synthesizing data to automatically generate predictive IFTTT-style rules tailored to an individual user’s behavior. I also designed a visualization feature so that individuals can better understand their usage patterns and determine whether the generated rules align with their daily behaviors.
