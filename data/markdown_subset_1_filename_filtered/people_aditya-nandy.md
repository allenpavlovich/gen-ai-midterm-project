# Aditya Nandy

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Aditya Nandy is working on a shape-changing membrane protein present in the inner ear, uniquely called prestin due to its fast kinetics. This protein governs the movement of the outer hair cell of the inner ear, enabling mammals to hear across wide frequency ranges. He is investigating how multiple prestin molecules are coupled to each other in the outer hair cell, leading to emergent phenomena that cannot be explained by a single prestin molecule. At the University of Chicago, Aditya is interested in learning more about the applications of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and AI/ML to biophysical systems. He is modeling the outer hair cell (and prestin) from both atomistic and continuum perspectives.

**BIO**:

Aditya Nandy joined the University of Chicago in 2023 as an Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow, working jointly between Profs. Benoit Roux, Eduardo Perozo, and Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan. He received his Ph.D. in Theoretical Chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under the supervision of Prof. Heather J. Kulik, where he was a NSF Graduate Research Fellow. During his Ph.D., Aditya used data-driven methods to explore large design spaces of transition metal complexes and metal-organic frameworks that could be useful for catalysis or gas separations applications. Prior to MIT, Aditya received his B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was an experimental NMR spectroscopist under the tutelage of Prof. Jeffrey A. Reimer. In 2025, Aditya will start his independent career at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department.
