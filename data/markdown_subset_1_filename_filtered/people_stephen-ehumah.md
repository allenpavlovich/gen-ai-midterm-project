# Stephen Ehumah

Undergraduate, North Central College

**Mentors:**Daniel Grzenda & [David Uminsky](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-uminsky/)

**Project Title:**Social Impact Track – Human Rights Media Analysis

**Project Description:**The ongoing pandemic disrupted the UN’s Office of Human Rights’ ability to conduct field monitoring, leading them to identify human rights incidents from news media. We implemented a Human Rights Media Analysis software tool which automates much of the early stages of data processing for the UNOHCHR. Our tool extracts features from a human rights report/news article and assigns a credibility score (low, medium or high) to the article.
