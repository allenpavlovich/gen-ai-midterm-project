In recent news, Deepfakes have been written to seem alarmingly easy to make. The aim of my summer project was to generate Deepfakes myself, to gain greater exposure to Machine Learning and to test the learning curve. Using an encoder-decoder architecture, we roughly swapped the faces of two program coordinators (as well as that of Nicholas Cage).
