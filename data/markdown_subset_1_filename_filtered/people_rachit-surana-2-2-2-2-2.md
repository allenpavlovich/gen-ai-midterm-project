# Yair Atlas

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project:**Automated Experimental Design for Cosmic Discovery

**Mentor:** [Brian Nord](https://computing.fnal.gov/brian-nord/) & [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen.org/) // Fermilab, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Department of Computer Science

**Research Area Keywords:** Machine Learning & AI // Physics & Astronomy

**Project Description:**Yair Atlas is a junior at the University of Chicago studying physics and philosophy, and was a previous CDAC intern in the 2019 program. This summer he worked with Drs. [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen.org/) and [Brian Nord](https://computing.fnal.gov/brian-nord/) on a CDAC Discovery Project titled, “[Automated Experimental Design for Cosmic Discovery](/research/automated-experimental-design-for-cosmic-discovery/).” This project focused on using machine learning to improve astrophysical surveys. Specifically, the project used a simulation facility to better understand how design features affect experimental results.
