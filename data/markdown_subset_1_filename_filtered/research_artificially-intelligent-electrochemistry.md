# Artificially Intelligent Electrochemistry

Chibueze Amanchukwu, and Rajeev Assary

Use AI to find new, efficient ways of “recycling” CO2 into valuable products such as ethanol and ethylene, using clean electricity generated from the sun and wind

Carbon dioxide emissions are a leading contributor to global climate change, but with the right electrocatalyst and electrolyte, it could instead be a new resource for energy sustainability. The team of [Chibueze Amanchukwu](https://pme.uchicago.edu/faculty/chibueze-amanchukwu), an assistant professor at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, and [Rajeev Assary](https://www.anl.gov/profile/rajeev-surendran-assary), a staff scientist at Materials Science Division of Argonne, will use AI to find new, efficient ways of “recycling” CO2 into valuable products such as ethanol and ethylene, using clean electricity generated from the sun and wind. The researchers will use quantum chemistry-informed machine learning to sift through computational and experimental data and find new electrolytes that can improve the conversion process. Experiments will then be performed using these obtained chemical insights. 

*This project was funded by the AI + Science initiative, a program organized by the University of Chicago [Office of Research and National Laboratories](https://researchinnovation.uchicago.edu/) in collaboration with the Center for Data and Computing aimed at increasing interactions among the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.*
