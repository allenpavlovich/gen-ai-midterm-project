# Kaushal Gumpula

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Mentors:**[Giuseppe B. Cerati](https://computing.fnal.gov/giuseppe-cerati/) & [Jeremy Hewes](https://www.dunescience.org/facesofdune/jeremy-hewes/) & Daniel Grzenda

**Project Title:**Exa.TrkX

**Project Description:**I worked on the Exa.TrkX project which presents a graph neural network (GNN) technique for low-level reconstruction of neutrino interactions in a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC). Graphs describing particle interactions are formed by treating each detector hit as a node, with vertices describing the relationships between hits. The model itself is a multihead attention message passing network which performs graph convolutions in order to label each node with a particle type.
