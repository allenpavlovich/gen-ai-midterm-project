# Shailaja Seetharaman

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**

As a Schmidt AI in Science Fellow, Shailaja Seetharaman will leverage novel AI/ML approaches to understand one of the most basic questions in biology – how cells and tissues function collectively and how this knowledge can be exploited to engineer living systems. Specifically, focusing on the role of endothelial mechanotransduction, Seetharaman will utilize ML algorithms to predict the cell and tissue-scale dynamics contributing to health and disease, and engineer model tissues that mitigate disease progression.

**BIO:**

Shailaja Seetharaman is a postdoctoral researcher in the Gardel Lab at the University of Chicago. She received her PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology from Institut Pasteur, Paris, and her Master’s in Biomedical and Molecular Sciences from King’s College London. Her research interests lie in the field of cell and tissue mechanics, focusing on the role of cytoskeletal networks and adhesion complexes in physiology and pathology. In particular, she is working towards understanding endothelial mechanotransduction in disease progression. She is the recipient of American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship, Yen Postdoctoral Fellowship, and the Marie Curie and FRM PhD fellowships.
