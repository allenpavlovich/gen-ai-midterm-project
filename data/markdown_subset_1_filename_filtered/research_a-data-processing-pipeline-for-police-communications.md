# A Data Processing Pipeline for Police Communications

Margaret Beale Spencer, and Karen Livescu

Build a pipeline for automatically transcribing law enforcement radio communications, creating a new data source for the study of adverse police outcomes.

The procedural language law enforcement officers use to communicate with each other can help us understand the institutional, individual, and contextual factors driving the outcomes of policing incidents. Using a public archive of law enforcement radio communications in the City of Chicago (~45,000 hours of observation), the project will develop a data processing pipeline capable of transforming these broadcast communications into transcripts of discrete policing incidents. This novel data source will allow researchers to test the linguistic antecedents to adverse outcomes, such as uses of force, involving minority male youth.

Principal Investigators: Margaret Beale Spencer (Marshall Field IV Professor, Urban Education), Karen Livescu (Professor, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago)
