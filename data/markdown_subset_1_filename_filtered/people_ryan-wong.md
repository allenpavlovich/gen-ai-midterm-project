**Project: Extracting Metadata with XtractHub**

**Mentor/Lab:** [Tyler Skluzacek/Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/people.html)

**Research Area Keywords:** Databases

[XtractHub](https://github.com/xtracthub/xtracthub) is a dynamic metadata extraction workflow. This summer I improved the efficiency of multiple metadata extractors, implemented Docker into the XtractHub workflow, and developed a web server for processing individual file metadata.

***Project News:*** The [paper](https://www.serverlesscomputing.org/wosc5/#p8) that grew out of this research, titled “Serverless Workflows for Indexing Large Scientific Data”, was accepted at the Fifth International Workshop on Serverless Computing (WoSC) 2019.
