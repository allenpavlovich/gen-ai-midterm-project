# Patricia Chiril

Postdoctoral Scholar, Data Science Institute

Patricia Chiril joined DSI as a postdoctoral scholar in winter 2022, and has previously completed her doctoral degree at the University of Toulouse, France.

She is committed to developing robust hate speech detection systems capable of adapting their predictions in the presence of novel or different topics and targets, as well as endowing these systems with affective intelligence.

Her recent research focuses on analyzing how different characters are represented in children’s books to better understand how the messages children encounter can impact their behavior, motivational dispositions and attitudes.
