**Abstract:** Neuromorphic computing is a popular technology for the future of computing.  Much of the focus in neuromorphic computing research and development has focused on new architectures, devices, and materials, rather than in the software, algorithms, and applications of these systems.  In this talk, I will overview the field of neuromorphic from the computer science perspective.  I will give an introduction to spiking neural networks, as well as some of the most common algorithms used in the field.  Finally, I will discuss the potential for using neuromorphic systems in real-world applications from scientific data analysis to autonomous vehicles.

!**Bio: Catherine (Katie) Schuman** is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee (UT). She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from UT in 2015, where she completed her dissertation on the use of evolutionary algorithms to train spiking neural networks for neuromorphic systems. Katie previously served as a research scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where her research focused on algorithms and applications of neuromorphic systems. Katie co-leads the TENNLab Neuromorphic Computing Research Group at UT. She has over 70 publications as well as seven patents in the field of neuromorphic computing. She received the Department of Energy Early Career Award in 2019. Katie is a senior member of the Association of Computing Machinery and the IEEE.
