# Jordan Shivers

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Jordan Shivers is broadly interested in using tools from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to understand the mechanics and dynamics of living cells. Currently, he is exploring applications of physics-informed graph neural networks for both accelerating the simulation of interacting cellular components (e.g. molecular motors, cytoskeletal polymers, and lipid membranes) and learning interpretable physical descriptions of dynamic cellular processes.

**BIO**:

Jordan Shivers joined the University of Chicago in 2022 as a Kadanoff-Rice fellow working jointly with Prof. Aaron Dinner and Prof. Suri Vaikuntanathan. He received his Ph.D. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Rice University under the supervision of Prof. Fred MacKintosh, where he studied mechanical phase transitions in biopolymer networks and composites.
