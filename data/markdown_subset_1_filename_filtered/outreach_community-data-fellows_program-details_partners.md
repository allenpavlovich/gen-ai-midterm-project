# Partner with Us

Community organizations supporting marginalized or underserved communities are welcome to partner with the Community Data Fellows program. Interested organizations are invited to [contact program staff](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/susan-paykin/) for more information. Organizations can expect to have an initial meeting to discuss their needs and goals. If a partnership is established, organizations will receive a detailed project scope outlining the process and deliverables for the project. Students and staff regularly coordinate with partners throughout the entire process to discuss updates and tailor solutions to their needs and capacity.
