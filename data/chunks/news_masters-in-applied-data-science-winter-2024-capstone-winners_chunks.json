On March 2, MS in Applied Data Science students, faculty, alumni, industry partners, and judges gathered as nine teams presented capstone projects spanning various industries, data types, and methodologies.\n\nAt the Winter Showcase, judges selected two teams for special recognition. Learn more about the winning projects below:\n\n**Deloitte: Using LLM to Build Industry Personas**\n\nStudents: Davi Aragao, Nathan Deweerdt, Mayur Kumar, Sanket Mayekar\n\nAdvisor: [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/)\n\nDavi Aragao, Nathan Deweerdt, Mayur Kumar, and Sanket Mayekar developed a solution for Deloitte focused on creating industry-specific large language model (LLM) personas. This approach aims to enhance Deloitte’s ability to tailor strategies, communications, and products or services for more effective client engagement. The team stated, “our financial analysis indicates that our solution could save up to $1.3 million in cost savings, with more added as it scales.”\n\nThe team expressed confidence in delivering a strong prototype, which includes a comprehensive data pipeline, a customizable persona and prompt generator, a front-end web application, and a thorough evaluation process to assess system performance. Initial testing results indicate that the prototype shows great promise.\n\nPaula Payton, the team sponsor and head of Data Science and Survey Advisory at Deloitte, said, “this team was so resourceful in terms of identifying data sources, and you certainly proved your mettle in terms of thinking very creatively about YouTube videos to find the voice of C-suite leaders.”\n\n**Circana: CPG Price Optimization**\n\nStudents: Jupiter Angulo, Josefina Bollini, Ben Cox, Ezra Kim\n\nAdvisor: Anil Chaturvedi\n\nJupiter Angulo, Josefina Bollini, Ben Cox, and Ezra Kim partnered with Circana to develop a framework for understanding consumer behavior and willingness to pay. The team said, “The implication for manufacturers, product developers, and retailers is that they need to figure out ways to more effectively reach the consumer where they are and figure out what incentivizes consumers to purchase things.”\n\nCurrent methods for this task are considered outdated, time-consuming, and reliant on consumer surveys. The team developed a framework that is generalizable, scalable, and uses non-survey-driven methods to understand the consumer preferences Circana wanted to explore further. Their methodology utilizes a generalized utility model to calculate the value of attributes across multiple categories, along with price elasticities using point-of-sale data and item attributes.\n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n\n**Argonne: Real-time Object Detection for Avian-solar Interactions**\n\nStudents: Aaron Chan, Aashish Singh, Alice Wang, Weiting Ye\n\nAdvisor: Igor Yakushin\n\n**Independent Research: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation**\n\nStudents: Nathan Pak, Tyler Roth, Isaac Silver\n\nAdvisor: Ashish Pujari",
