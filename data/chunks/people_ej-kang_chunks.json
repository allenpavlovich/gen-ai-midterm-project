Throughout this period, I’ve engaged with various company functions, all with the common objective of uncovering meaningful insights through data. My motivation has always been to see the impact of my work, whether it’s driving revenue growth or supporting overall company goals. I’m fortunate to have my career take shape the way it has so far, and I’m excited to continue pushing the boundaries of data science, making meaningful contributions in this ever-evolving field.\n\n#### What were the top 1-3 factors that went into your decision to choose the MS in Applied Data Science Program at UChicago?\n\nWhen considering my decision to pursue the MS in Applied Data Science Program at UChicago, I was influenced by several compelling factors. Firstly, the curriculum was a standout feature. The core courses provide a comprehensive exploration of the theoretical foundations of data science, ranging from fundamental concepts like linear regression to cutting-edge techniques such as deep learning. Additionally, the availability of elective courses allows for a deeper dive into specific subjects. I was specially intrigued by Bayesian Methods and ML Ops electives. Lastly, the allure of Chicago itself, with its vibrant atmosphere and rich culture, played a part in finalizing my decision.\n\n#### What was one of your favorite aspects of being a student at UChicago?\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of being a student at UChicago is the university’s renowned reputation for academic excellence. The rigorous curriculum and intellectual environment at UChicago provide a stimulating and well-structured learning experience.\n\n#### What was one of your favorite classes you took at UChicago and why?\n\nMy favorite class at UChicago so far has been Bayesian Methods. This course captivated my interest due to the intriguing concept of frequentist vs. Bayesian approaches. Exploring the principles and applications of Bayesian statistics sparked my curiosity and made me realize the immense potential and future opportunities in this field.\n\n#### What do you enjoy doing outside of work?\n\nOutside of the program, I thoroughly enjoy exploring the vibrant city of Chicago. I relish visiting art galleries, attending live performances, and immersing myself in the city’s renowned culinary scene.\n\n#### What excites you right now about the field of data science?\n\nWhat excites me right now about the field of data science is the concept of prompt engineering and its potential. By carefully designing prompts, we can guide machine learning models to generate desired outputs, enabling us to tackle complex problems and extract valuable insights. This innovative approach not only enhances the interpretability and control of machine learning systems but also opens up new possibilities for driving impactful advancements in data science.\n\n#### What advice would you give to prospective students who are seeking a master’s degree in data science?\n\nRather than merely learning existing concepts, focus on developing the ability to absorb and adapt to new ideas. View the program not only as a source of knowledge but also as a pathway to explore and seek out new advancements in data science. Cultivate a curiosity-driven approach and a willingness to stay updated with the latest developments, as this will be crucial for long-term success in this ever-evolving field.",
