They found that the resulting model can rank-order readmission risk, allowing flexibility to apply interventions that prevent readmission.\n\n#### An NFL Ticket Pricing Study: Optimizing Revenue Using Variable and Dynamic Pricing Methods\n\nUChicago Applied Data Science students developed a strategy for an NFL team to implement ticket pricing that responds to changing factors, giving the team the opportunity to fill more seats.\n\n#### Using Image Recognition to Identify Yoga Poses\n\nUChicago Applied Data Science students built an app that uses a one-step neural network to analyze images of yoga poses and recognize them, providing feedback to the app’s yoga-practicing user.\n\n#### Using Image Recognition to Measure the Speed of a Pitch\n\nA UChicago Applied Data Science Capstone team developed an app that uses image-recognition algorithms to measure the speed of a pitched baseball. The app captures video, isolates the pitched ball, calculates the pitch's velocity, and displays the measurement, enabling users to measure pitch speed with their smartphones.\n\n#### Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection\n\nCredit-card fraud puts consumers’ identities at risk and forces providers to cover fraudulent charges. A team of Applied Data Science students addressed this problem by creating synthetic data representing a large population of credit-card users and building a model that detects credit-card fraud in real time.",
