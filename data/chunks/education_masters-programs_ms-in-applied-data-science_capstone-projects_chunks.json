They determined that the resulting model is capable of rank-ordering readmission risk, allowing for flexibility and giving air to apply interventions to prevent readmission.\n\n#### An NFL Ticket Pricing Study: Optimizing Revenue Using Variable and Dynamic Pricing Methods\n\nUChicago Applied Data Science students strategized a play for an NFL team to implement ticket pricing that responds to changing factors, allowing the team the chance to fill more seats.\n\n#### Using Image Recognition to Identify Yoga Poses\n\nUChicago Applied Data Science students stretched themselves to build an app that uses a one-step neural network to examine images of yoga poses and recognize the poses in order to provide feedback to the app’s yoga-practicing user.\n\n#### Using Image Recognition to Measure the Speed of a Pitch\n\nOne UChicago Applied Data Science Capstone team developed an app that applied image-recognition algorithms to measure the speed of a pitched baseball. Their ace app captured video, isolated the pitched ball, calculated the velocity of the pitch, and displayed this measurement so that users would be able to measure the speed of a pitch with their smartphones.\n\n#### Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection\n\nCredit-card fraud puts consumers’ identities at risk while credit-card providers are forced to cover fraudulent charges. A team of Applied Data Science students carefully studied this problem – they created synthetic data that represented a large population of credit-card users and built a model that catches credit-card fraud in real time.",

    "page_content": "### Interested in Becoming a Capstone Sponsor?\n\nThe Master’s in Applied Data Science program accepts projects year-round for placement during the Spring and Autumn quarters, with Spring being the largest cohort. Projects must be submitted no later than one month prior to the preferred starting quarter based on the [UChicago academic calendar](https://www.uchicago.edu/en/education-and-research/academic-calendar).\n\n**Want more information?** Find details and answers to FAQs in the [Capstone Sponsorship Guidelines (PDF)](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MS-ADS-Capstone-Sponsor-Guide-2025-2.pdf).\n\n#### Capstone Sponsor Incentives\n\nPartner organizations propose real-world problems, untested ideas, or research queries. Students, guided by instructors and researchers, generate actionable insights that provide long-term value. Benefits to sponsors include:\n\n* Access to a pool of world-class students, accomplished instructors, and cited researchers\n* Optimized use of modern data-science methods with your data\n* A meaningful recruitment pipeline via the student team working on your project\n\n#### Capstone Sponsor Obligations\n\nThere is no monetary cost or contract, but we consider this a partnership. Sponsors should be prepared to provide:\n\n* A detailed problem statement describing the data and expected results\n* **Two or more** points of contact\n* Access to project data by the first week of the quarter\n* Engagement through regular meetings (typically bi-weekly) while classes are in session\n* A non-disclosure agreement for the team, if required",
