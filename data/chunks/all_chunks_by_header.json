    "page_content": "### Core Courses\n\n#### Time Series Analysis and Forecasting\n\nTime Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.\n\n#### Statistical Models for Data Science\n\nIn a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries. New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n#### Machine Learning I\n\nThis course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies.\n\n#### Machine Learning II\n\nThe objective of this course is three-folds–first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications.\n\n#### Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing\n\nData Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market.\n\nBig Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data and multiple emerging software packages exist to work with it, and we will cover the most popular approaches.\n\n#### Leadership and Consulting for Data Science\n\nThe Leadership and Consulting for Data Scientist course is focused on:\n\n* Learning techniques and proven methods to effectively grasp the business domain including organizational dynamics of consultancies and client organizations\n* Developing relevant solutions to enterprise problems using the sampling methods, traditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning models that deliver value to the organization\n* Practicing successful project delivery through effective data discovery, influential team membership and leadership, project management, and communication at every stage\n\nThis course will not only make you a better data scientist; it will make you and your analyses more approachable, more persuasive, and ultimately more successful.\n\n#### Data Science Capstone Project\n\nThe required Capstone Project is completed over two quarters and covers research design, implementation, and writing. Full-time students start their capstone project in their third quarter. Part-time students generally begin the capstone project in their fifth quarter.",

    "page_content": "### Sample Elective Courses\n\n#### Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning\n\nComputer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state-of-the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\n\n#### Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\n\nSince the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n\n#### Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications\n\nThis course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning.

We will cover such topics as security concerns unique to the field, research design strategies, and the integration of epidemiologic and quality improvement methodologies to operationalize data for continuous improvement. Students will be introduced to the application of predictive analytics to healthcare. Students will understand factors impacting the delivery of quality and safe patient care and the application of data-driven methods to improve care at the healthcare system level, design approaches to answering a research question at the population level, become familiar with the application of data analytics to impacting care at the provider level through Clinical Decision Systems, and understand the process of a Clinical Trial.\n\n#### Financial Analytics\n\nThis course concentrates on the following topics: review of financial markets and assets traded on them; main characteristics of financial analytics: returns, yields, volatility; review of stochastic models of market price and their statistical representations; concept of arbitrage, elements of arbitrage pricing approach; principles of volatility analyses, implied vs. realized volatility; correlation, cointegration and other relationships between various financial assets; market risk analytics and management of portfolios of financial assets. The course puts special emphasis on covering main steps of building analytics from visualizing data and building intuition about their structure and patterns to selecting appropriate statistical method to interpretation of the results and building analytical models. Topics are illustrated by data analysis projects using R. Basic familiarity with R is a requirement.\n\n#### Generative AI Principles\n\nThis course dives into the realm of Generative AI, offering a comprehensive look into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation techniques, and the fusion of vision and text through multimodal models. Drawing from core concepts in neural networks, transformers, and advanced techniques such as prompt engineering, vision prompting, and multimodality representation, students will explore the capabilities, applications, and ethical considerations of generative models. This course culminates in hands-on projects, allowing participants to apply theory to practical scenarios.\n\n#### Machine Learning Operations\n\nThe objective of this course is two-fold: first, to understand what Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is and why it is a key component in enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects, and second, to expose students to software engineering, model engineering and state-of-the-art deployment engineering with hands-on platform and tools experience. This course crosses the chasm that separates machine learning projects/experiments and enterprise production deployment. It covers three pillars in MLOps: software engineering such as software architecture, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and data versioning; model engineering such as AutoML and A/B experimentation; and deployment engineering such as docker containers and model monitoring. The course focuses on best practices in the industry that are critical to enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects. Having completed this course, a student understands the machine learning lifecycle and what it takes to go from ideation to operationalization in an enterprise environment. Furthermore, students get exposure to state-of-the-art MLOps platforms such as allegro, xpresso, Dataiku, LityxIQ, DataRobot, AWS Sagemaker, and technologies such as gitHub, Jenkins, slack, docker, and kubernetes.\n\n#### Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing\n\nExtracting actionable insights from unstructured text and designing cognitive applications have become significant areas of application for analytics. Students in this course will learn foundations of natural language processing, including: concept extraction; text summarization and topic modeling; part of speech tagging; named entity recognition; semantic roles and sentiment analysis. For advanced NLP applications, we will focus on feature extraction from unstructured text, including word and paragraph embedding and representing words and paragraphs as vectors. For cognitive analytics section of the course, students will practice designing question answering systems with intent classification, semantic knowledge extraction and reasoning under uncertainty. Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding.\n\n#### Real Time Intelligent Systems\n\nDeveloping end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students. The course focuses on python and is tailored for students with basic programming knowledge in python. The course is partially project based. During the first three sessions, we will review basic python concepts and then learn more advanced python and the ways to use python to handle large data flows. The later sessions are project based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems.\n\n#### Reinforcement Learning\n\nThis course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\n\n#### Supply Chain Optimization\n\n“Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made-to-order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain. Students will also learn how to optimize the performance of the Supply Chain from the lens of multiple related disciplines including: Sales Forecasting, Warehousing/Inventory Management, Promotion, Pricing, Logistics Network Optimization, Freight Cost Management, Manufacturing, Retail POS Information, Ecommerce, Consumer Data, and Product Design/Packaging. After completing this course, you will be prepared to work in any of the numerous specialty areas possible in the world of Supply Chain Management.",

    "page_content": "### Core Courses\n\n#### Time Series Analysis and Forecasting (Core Course)\n\nTime Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.\n\n#### Statistical Models for Data Science (Core Course)\n\nIn a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries. New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n#### Machine Learning I (Core Course)\n\nThis course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies.\n\n#### Machine Learning II (Core Course)\n\nThe objective of this course is three-folds–first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications.\n\n#### Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing (Core Course)\n\nData Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market.\n\nBig Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data and multiple emerging software packages exist to work with it, and we will cover the most popular approaches.\n\n#### Leadership and Consulting for Data Science (Core Course)\n\nThe Leadership and Consulting for Data Scientist course is focused on:\n* Learning techniques and proven methods to effectively grasp the business domain including organizational dynamics of consultancies and client organizations\n* Developing relevant solutions to enterprise problems using the sampling methods, traditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning models that deliver value to the organization\n* Practicing successful project delivery through effective data discovery, influential team membership and leadership, project management, and communication at every stage\n\nThis course will not only make you a better data scientist; it will make you and your analyses more approachable, more persuasive, and ultimately more successful.\n\n#### Data Science Capstone Project (Core Course)\n\nThe required Capstone Project is completed over two quarters and covers research design, implementation, and writing. Full-time students start their capstone project in their third quarter. Part-time students generally begin the capstone project in their fifth quarter.",

It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.\n\n  * Statistical Models for Data Science (Core Course)\n\n    In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries. New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n  * Machine Learning I (Core Course)\n\n    This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies.\n\n  * Machine Learning II (Core Course)\n\n    The objective of this course is three-folds–first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications.\n\n  * Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing (Core Course)\n\n    Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market.\n\n    Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data and multiple emerging software packages exist to work with it, and we will cover the most popular approaches.\n\n  * Leadership and Consulting for Data Science (Core Course)\n\n    The Leadership and Consulting for Data Scientist course is focused on:\n\n    • Learning techniques and proven methods to effectively grasp the business domain including organizational dynamics of consultancies and client organizations\n    • Developing relevant solutions to enterprise problems using the sampling methods, traditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning models that deliver value to the organization\n    • Practicing successful project delivery through effective data discovery, influential team membership and leadership, project management, and communication at every stage\n\n    This course will not only make you a better data scientist; it will make you and your analyses more approachable, more persuasive, and ultimately more successful.\n\n  * Data Science Capstone Project (Core Course)\n\n    The required Capstone Project is completed over two quarters and covers research design, implementation, and writing. Full-time students start their capstone project in their third quarter. Part-time students generally begin the capstone project in their fifth quarter.\n\n* Sample Elective Courses\n\n  * Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning (Elective Course)\n\n    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\n\n  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (Elective Course)\n\n    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n\n  * Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications (Elective Course)\n\n    This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.\n\n  * Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing (Elective Course)\n\n    This course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI. The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class discussions, group assignments, and a final group project. The course lays special emphasis on algorithms. Hence it draws heavily from the fields of optimization, machine-learning based recommendation systems, association rules, consumer choice models, Bayesian estimation, experimentation and analysis of covariance, advanced visualization techniques for mapping brand perceptions, and analysis of social media data using advanced NLP techniques.\n\n  * Data Science for Healthcare (Elective Course)\n\n    Given the breadth of the field of health analytics, this course will provide an overview of the development and rapid expansion of analytics in healthcare, major and emerging topical areas, and current issues related to research methods to improve human health. We will cover such topics as security concerns unique to the field, research design strategies, and the integration of epidemiologic and quality improvement methodologies to operationalize data for continuous improvement. Students will be introduced to the application of predictive analytics to healthcare. Students will understand factors impacting the delivery of quality and safe patient care and the application of data-driven methods to improve care at the healthcare system level, design approaches to answering a research question at the population level, become familiar with the application of data analytics to impacting care at the provider level through Clinical Decision Systems, and understand the process of a Clinical Trial.\n\n  * Data Visualization Techniques (Elective Course)\n\n    In today’s data driven enterprise, data storytelling using effective visualization strategies is an essential skill for analytics practitioners in almost every field to explore and present data. This course focuses on modern data visualization technologies, tools, and techniques to convert raw data into actionable information. Modern data visualization tools are at the forefront of the “self-service analytics” architectures which are decentralizing analytics and breaking down IT bottlenecks for business experts. Moreover, with its foundations rooted in statistics, psychology, and computer science, data visualization shows you how to better understand the data, present clear evidence of your findings to your intended audience and tell engaging data stories through charts and graphics. This course is designed to introduce data visualization as a medium of effective communication using strategic storytelling, and the basis for interactive information dashboards.\n\n  * Digital Marketing Analytics in Theory and Practice (Elective Course)\n\n    Successfully marketing brands today requires a well-balanced blend of art and science. This course introduces students to the science of web analytics while casting a keen eye toward the artful use of numbers found in the digital space. The goal is to provide marketers with the foundation needed to apply data analytics to real-world challenges they confront daily in their professional lives.

It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.\n\n  * Statistical Models for Data Science\n\n    In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n  * Machine Learning I\n\n    This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies.\n\n  * Machine Learning II\n\n    The objective of this course is three-folds–first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications.\n\n  * Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing\n\n    Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market.\n\n    Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data and multiple emerging software packages exist to work with it, and we will cover the most popular approaches.\n\n  * Leadership and Consulting for Data Science\n\n    The Leadership and Consulting for Data Scientist course is focused on:\n\n    • Learning techniques and proven methods to effectively grasp the business domain including organizational dynamics of consultancies and client organizations\n    • Developing relevant solutions to enterprise problems using the sampling methods, traditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning models that deliver value to the organization\n    • Practicing successful project delivery through effective data discovery, influential team membership and leadership, project management, and communication at every stage\n\n    This course will not only make you a better data scientist; it will make you and your analyses more approachable, more persuasive, and ultimately more successful.\n\n  * Data Science Capstone Project\n\n    The required Capstone Project is completed over two quarters and covers research design, implementation, and writing. Full-time students start their capstone project in their third quarter. Part-time students generally begin the capstone project in their fifth quarter.\n\n* Sample Elective Courses\n\n  * Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning\n\n    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.\n\n  * Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\n\n    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n\n  * Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications\n\n    This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.\n\n  * Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing\n\n    This course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI. The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class discussions, group assignments, and a final group project. The course lays special emphasis on algorithms. Hence it draws heavily from the fields of optimization, machine-learning based recommendation systems, association rules, consumer choice models, Bayesian estimation, experimentation and analysis of covariance, advanced visualization techniques for mapping brand perceptions, and analysis of social media data using advanced NLP techniques.\n\n  * Data Science for Healthcare\n\n    Given the breadth of the field of health analytics, this course will provide an overview of the development and rapid expansion of analytics in healthcare, major and emerging topical areas, and current issues related to research methods to improve human health. We will cover such topics as security concerns unique to the field, research design strategies, and the integration of epidemiologic and quality improvement methodologies to operationalize data for continuous improvement. Students will be introduced to the application of predictive analytics to healthcare. Students will understand factors impacting the delivery of quality and safe patient care and the application of data-driven methods to improve care at the healthcare system level, design approaches to answering a research question at the population level, become familiar with the application of data analytics to impacting care at the provider level through Clinical Decision Systems, and understand the process of a Clinical Trial.\n\n  * Data Visualization Techniques\n\n    In today’s data driven enterprise, data storytelling using effective visualization strategies is an essential skill for analytics practitioners in almost every field to explore and present data. This course focuses on modern data visualization technologies, tools, and techniques to convert raw data into actionable information. Modern data visualization tools are at the forefront of the “self-service analytics” architectures which are decentralizing analytics and breaking down IT bottlenecks for business experts. Moreover, with its foundations rooted in statistics, psychology, and computer science, data visualization shows you how to better understand the data, present clear evidence of your findings to your intended audience and tell engaging data stories through charts and graphics. This course is designed to introduce data visualization as a medium of effective communication using strategic storytelling, and the basis for interactive information dashboards.\n\n  * Digital Marketing Analytics in Theory and Practice\n\n    Successfully marketing brands today requires a well-balanced blend of art and science. This course introduces students to the science of web analytics while casting a keen eye toward the artful use of numbers found in the digital space. The goal is to provide marketers with the foundation needed to apply data analytics to real-world challenges they confront daily in their professional lives.

For advanced NLP applications, we will focus on feature extraction from unstructured text, including word and paragraph embedding and representing words and paragraphs as vectors. For cognitive analytics section of the course, students will practice designing question answering systems with intent classification, semantic knowledge extraction and reasoning under uncertainty. Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding.\n\n  * Real Time Intelligent Systems\n\n    Developing end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students. The course focuses on python and is tailored for students with basic programming knowledge in python. The course is partially project based. During the first three sessions, we will review basic python concepts and then learn more advanced python and the ways to use python to handle large data flows. The later sessions are project based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems.\n\n  * Reinforcement Learning\n\n    This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\n\n  * Supply Chain Optimization\n\n    “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain. Students will also learn how to optimize the performance of the Supply Chain from the lens of multiple related disciplines including: Sales Forecasting, Warehousing/Inventory Management, Promotion, Pricing, Logistics Network Optimization, Freight Cost Management, Manufacturing, Retail POS Information, Ecommerce, Consumer Data, and Product Design/Packaging. After completing this course, you will be prepared to work in any of the numerous specialty areas possible in the world of Supply Chain Management.",

    "page_content": "Applied Data ScienceOct 22, 2024\n\nBefore you submit your MS in Applied Data Science application, explore some key traits we look for in our candidates.\n\nThinking about applying to the [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program at the University of Chicago? We’re thrilled to have you here! Our program is designed for ambitious problem-solvers ready to make a difference in fields ranging from healthcare to finance and beyond. To help you put your best foot forward, we’re sharing a few key traits we look for in applicants. Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist looking to level up your career or considering a career switch to data science, here’s what you need to know to stand out and succeed.\n\n**Trait #1: Some Prior Experience with Python or R**\n\nLet’s start with the basics. No, we don’t need you to be a coding wizard (though, if you are, that’s awesome!). But you should have dabbled a bit in Python or R. What does that mean? If someone says, “Download this library in Jupyter Notebook,” you shouldn’t be scratching your head. Instead, you should be nodding along, maybe even excited to try it out.\n\nKnow your data types—strings, Booleans, integers, floats, all that jazz. And if you’ve played around with data frames or created some basic data visualizations, you’re on the right track.\n\nIf this sounds foreign, don’t panic! There are great resources to help you get up to speed without breaking the bank. Daniel Truesdale, one of our own, started with the Coursera course “[Programming for Everybody Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python).” He also honed his skills through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) competitions.\n\nIn short, you don’t need a technical background, but some familiarity with Python or R is key.\n\n**Trait #2: Collaboration is Key**\n\nOur students are movers and shakers, ready to make an impact in tech, finance, sports, media, healthcare, education, government, logistics—you name it. Transitioning from theory to real-world impact means working well with others. We look for students who are:\n\n* **Team Players**: You’re comfortable working alongside people from different backgrounds and perspectives.\n* **Community Builders**: You want to be part of our community, help build it, and stay connected even after graduation.\n\nYou’ll learn a lot from our faculty, but also from your classmates. Grad school is as much about building your network as it is about hitting the books.\n\n**Trait #3: Be Authentic**\n\nJust be yourself. We don’t expect you to be a master of math, statistics, and programming before you even start (otherwise, why would you need us?). Be open about where you need to grow, but also proud of what you bring to the table.\n\nAuthenticity goes a long way. It helps us understand who you are and how you’ll fit into and contribute to our community.\n\nSo, if you’re thinking about applying, keep these traits in mind. We can’t wait to see what you’ll bring to the University of Chicago!\n\n**Trait #4: Relax and communicate effectively**\n\nStudents must submit a video recording of themselves answering one question as part of their application requirements, a second video prompt is optional. Practice presenting in front of the camera and review the video before submitting. Make sure you are speaking loudly and calmly. We encourage students to not read off of a script so you do not sound robotic. This is a chance for students to show their personality and effective communication skills. Also, it is recommended for students to treat the video requirement as if they are interviewing for a position; professional attire is encouraged.\n\nPresenting is common in our program, don’t worry if it’s not perfect as students will have plenty of opportunities to practice in the program.",

    "page_content": "# Jan Mrozowski’s Path from Industry Professional to Teaching in the MS in Applied Data Science Program\n\nFor Jan Mrozowski (MSADS ‘19), the journey to UChicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program was unexpected and, at first, unplanned. Originally from Eastern Europe and having lived in various countries, Mrozowski returned from Australia in late 2013 to begin the next chapter of his career in the United States. His first job offer with GE came with an intriguing opportunity. “I got three job offers, and all of them paid similar amounts of money, but GE told me that they pay 100% tuition at the school of my choice. So I was like, okay, and I joined GE and the University of Chicago at the same time,” he recalls, describing his entry into the newly launched program.\n\n#### **Academic Beginnings and Real-World Experience**\n\nWith over a decade of experience in marketing analytics, Mrozowski wasn’t new to data science when he entered the program. He started the Data Science function at Woolworths, Australia’s largest retailer, before the term “Data Science” was widely used, holding the title of Business Support Manager. Later, at GE, he led marketing analytics for the Sam’s Club credit card portfolio, adding valuable hands-on experience to his expertise. While he was already well-versed in analytics, the program helped refine his skills in areas like data engineering and cloud computing. “That helped me a lot in my career since I joined the program,” he says. “It definitely improved some of my skills, especially in the area of data engineering and cloud computing.”\n\n#### **The Accidental Teacher: From Student to Professor**\n\nMrozowski’s journey into teaching was as unplanned as his entry into the program. While collaborating with fellow students on an assignment, a group member—who also taught at another university—noticed his expertise and encouraged him to consider teaching. This led to his first teaching role at Benedictine University in Naperville while he was still a student. His passion for teaching grew from there. “When I was talking to professors at UChicago, they were like, ‘Why don’t you TA?’ So I thought, why not?” he shares.\n\nThis early teaching experience eventually inspired him to pursue a PhD in economics in Poland, sponsored by the National Bank of his native country. Upon returning to Chicago, Mrozowski enrolled in a consulting class taught by [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/) and [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/), who were part of the new leadership of the program. He appreciated the insights and perspectives they brought to the curriculum, noting how the program continued to evolve with fresh approaches. Since then, Mrozowski has served as a TA for multiple UChicago [Applied Data Science courses](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/), including *Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics*, *Big Data and Cloud Computing*, and *Time Series Analysis and Forecasting*, among others. Reflecting on his experiences, he muses, “If I didn’t go to Europe, maybe I would be teaching by now as well.”\n\n#### **A Love for Data Engineering**\n\nAmong the courses Mrozowski has TA’d, [Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/) stands out as a favorite. “I think data engineering is grossly underappreciated,” he explains. “Everybody’s focusing on model development, but it takes a lot of effort to prepare the data.” He shares an example from his current role as head of the risk department at Flex Shopper, where a recent intern was surprised by the complexity and time required for data preparation. “One piece of feedback she had was that she never understood how much time it takes to prepare the data for modeling.”\n\nMrozowski emphasizes that data engineering demands a deep understanding of data structures and access methods, which are critical for extracting and preparing data in the right format. He sees it as an essential foundation for success in the field. At every opportunity, he hires interns and employees from the program, recognizing their strong foundational skills and readiness to tackle real-world challenges.\n\n#### **Supporting Students Through Technical Challenges**\n\nFor Mrozowski, one of the most rewarding aspects of being a TA is helping students overcome technical hurdles. “Being able to help students when they say, ‘Yes, it finally works,’” he says. Whether troubleshooting code or guiding students through challenging concepts, he takes pride in enabling their success. “You wouldn’t believe how much time I sometimes spend with data engineering students when there is a little-known issue,” he says. From ensuring compatibility with Apple’s latest processors to addressing cloud computing problems, his support often extends beyond the curriculum.\n\n#### **Advice for New Students: Focus on Foundations and Networking**\n\nWhen asked what advice he would give to incoming students, Mrozowski underscores the importance of foundational courses. “Definitely pay more attention to data engineering and big data classes, because they will set you apart and prepare for success,” he advises. He also emphasizes networking, encouraging students to attend alumni events and build connections within the program’s professional network.\n\n#### **Looking Ahead**\n\nMrozowski’s unconventional path through the MS in Applied Data Science program has led him to fulfilling roles as a TA, mentor, and leader in his field. His journey—spanning multiple countries and professional milestones—highlights the importance of embracing unexpected opportunities. Mrozowski remains dedicated to supporting and inspiring students, reflecting his commitment to advancing the next generation of data science professionals.",

This event merges academic knowledge with practical, real-world challenges across various key research areas. This year, 37 capstone teams presented their projects, leading all phases of problem-solving with the support of faculty, staff, and industry experts. While projects spanned numerous industries, data types, and methodologies, all teams exhibited professionalism, pride, and commitment to excellence. The judges observed that the Showcase featured a diverse array of research-focused, industry-generated, and independent student projects spanning healthcare, marketing, supply chain, financial services, and more.\n\nPaula Payton is the Head of the Center for Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MInDS) at Deloitte Research & Insights. She also happened to be a distinguished industry judge for the Autumn 2024 Capstone Showcase, her third year running. Impressed with the caliber of the graduate student presentations, Payton said, “Talk about pushing back the frontiers in applied AI…. talented students presented unbelievably original solutions to classic industry problems. That was exciting for me to see as a professional in the field and also someone who cares very deeply about data science and AI education.”\n\nOne of the standout projects was “Once Upon,” a storytelling app that uses AI to craft personalized stories for children based on their imagination and preferences. The team, consisting of Hima Cheruvu, Nia Gangar, Rishika Ravindran, and Christian Piantanida, shared their inspiration: “Our inspiration came from a moment of pure frustration and imagination. A few years ago, one of our team members’ then 4-year-old neighbor tried to get Amazon Alexa to tell her a story about her favorite princess going to swimming class. Alexa couldn’t quite deliver, and her neighbor was so frustrated that she started yelling at Alexa. That experience stuck with her—it showed how much children want to hear stories that are unique and personally meaningful to them, yet existing technology struggled to meet that need.” The student team wanted to create a tool that inspires creativity while empowering kids to be part of the storytelling process.\n\nLearn more about the projects that won Best in Show below.\n\n**Inference Analytics |** **Multilingual Language Processing – Patient Facing Gen AI Information Retrieval Responder**\n\nPresenters: Yexuan Sun, Yahui Zhou, Maya Mireles Rios, Yun Yang\n\nFaculty Advisor: [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/)\n\n**Robotics | SKYSEARCH: Generalized Object Detection and Search**\n\nPresenters: Zachary Farahany, Duncan Calvert, Joon Park, Mohammad Ayan Raheel\n\nFaculty Advisor: [Steve Barry](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/stephen-barry/)\n\n**Chicago White Sox | Deriving Swing Value & Context from Biomechanics Data**\n\nPresenters: Hank Snowdon , Anthony Buti, Alexander Yeager, Devan Joshi\n\nFaculty Advisor: [Jeanette Shutay](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/jeanette-shutay-phd/)\n\n**Conversational AI | Once Upon**\n\nPresenters: Hima Cheruvu, Nia Gangar, Rishika Ravindran, Christian Piantanida\n\nFaculty Advisor: [Nick Kadochnikov](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/nick-kadochnikov/)\n\n**Museum of Illusions | Real Time & Predictive Analysis Process for an Immersive Entertainment Business**\n\nPresenters: Qinglin Chui, Nina Zhang, Bianca Gunawan, Syed Muhammad Hasan Zaidi\n\nFaculty Advisor: [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/)\n\n**GPT for Healthcare | MediNotes: SOAP Note Generation through Ambient Listening, LLM Fine-tuning & RAG**\n\nPresenters: Yuki Leong, Melody Gao, Christina Song, Johnny Ji\n\n**GPT for Healthcare | R2Gen2: Finetuning Multimodal AI for Radiology**\n\nPresenters: Aayush Verma, Ashmita Mukherjee, Rishab Mohan, Leo Li\n\nFaculty Advisor: [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/)#### **Honorable Mentions**\n\n**GPT for Healthcare | Radipedia: Customized, Transparent, and Multimodal Assistant for Radiology**\n\nPresenters: Lea Wu, Linda Ji, Vinezha Panca, Wyatt Meng\n\n**GPT for Healthcare | RadiGraph: Extracting Clinical Entities and Relationships from Radiology Reports into a Knowledge Graph Using LLMs**\n\nPresenters: Jiayi Deng, Ningxin Kong, Kaiheng Yao, Hongxuan Zhao\n\n**Conversational AI | InternationAlly by PropertyPilot**\n\nPresenters: Kshitiz Sahay, William DeForest, Yijing Sun, Daichi Ishikawa\n\n**Robotics | Innovative LEGO Design: Transforming Drone-captured 3D Model of Objects into LEGO Design Plan**\n\nPresenters: Phil Cooper, Nancy Gu, Thomas Shi, Peter Ye\n\n**UChicago Medicine | Prostate MR Image Segmentation with U-Nets and Transfer Learning**\n\nPresenters: Bender Russo, Junseong Park, Shubhankar Kumar, Wade Hou\n\nFaculty Advisor: [Batu Gundogdu](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/batu-gundogdu-phd/)\n\n**Inference Analytics | Medical Language Processing – LLM-based Radiology Annotation System**\n\nPresenters: Yezi Liu, Liuyi Pan, Kyu Sung Cho, Runyu Shang\n\n**Conversational AI | Trading Hero**\n\nPresenters: Kelvin Hsueh, Peter Fu Chen, Yaoning Yu, Nathan Chen",

The Summer Showcase featured projects spanning industries, data types, and methodological approaches—with one team standing out for special recognition.\n\n“The quality of the work was truly impressive and the teams deserve our congratulations for their hard work, professionalism, and commitment to excellence,” said [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/), Director of MS in Applied Data Science Program. “Their inventiveness was especially on display with the solutions they developed for their industry partners. We’re looking forward to staying connected and hearing about the graduates’ next achievements.”\n\n*Learn more about the winning project below.*\n**[UChicago Medicine](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/) | Medical Language Processing – Patient Based Radiology Question**\n**& Answering System**\n**Presenters: Ananth Prayaga, Evelyn Wu, Nitin Gupta, Vivian Yeh**\n**Faculty Advisor: [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/)**\n\nA key challenge in healthcare today centers around optimally using the enormous quantity of unstructured medical data available to healthcare professionals. Lacking a systematic and streamlined strategy, sorting through patient information demands significant time that could otherwise be spent directly with patients.\n\nFor their [Capstone Project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/), Ananth Prayaga, Evelyn Wu, Nitin Gupta, and Vivian Yeh focused on the labor-intensive process of reading radiology reports. They used a Closed Book Question-Answering (Q&A) System and the latest AI technologies to design an intelligent knowledge receiver, which they named ContextualAI, that can respond accurately to queries without external knowledge sources.\n\n“A central area of development in the generative AI field involves using LLMs to ingest site- or institution-specific data that can then be queried,” the team says. “Hospitals, financial services companies, and law firms don’t want to share their internal data with OpenAI or other AI systems due to security and privacy reasons. Our task involved creating a framework using an LLM that could ingest and query local data without compromising privacy or security.”\n\nFocused on optimizing workflow efficiency, increasing productivity, and alleviating physician burnout, the team tested existing Large Language Models (LLM) and vector databases across a variety of approaches as they developed their framework. Two separate requirements drove their search for a solution: one, ingesting the unstructured data of the partner institution and, two, teaching the LLM a new skill to work with that data.\n\nIn the end, the team attained the best performance from two of [Meta’s AI tools](https://ai.meta.com/), [Llama2](https://www.llama2.ai/) and [Faiss](https://faiss.ai/index.html), which generated answers with an approximate accuracy of 70% that the team validated using patient data and human evaluations.\n\n“But we won’t stop there,” the team says. “This is a growing field and new models are being released every few weeks, so we will continue testing as new areas for improvement arise. Our client has already started to deploy our product and has expressed strong interest in further collaboration.”\n\nThe team also highlights the transformative power of their project and its potential for applications that extend beyond healthcare into other domains. It points, they say, to a future where intelligent answers are just a question away.\n\n“This is just the beginning of what is possible and we’re really excited to see it developed further to reach its maximum potential.”",

On March 2, MS in Applied Data Science students, faculty, alumni, industry partners, and judges came together as nine teams presented their capstone projects that spanned numerous industries, data types, and methodologies.\n\nAt the Winter Showcase two teams were selected by the judges for special recognition. Learn more about the winning projects below:\n\n**Deloitte: Using LLM to Build Industry Personas**\n\nStudents: Davi Aragao, Nathan Deweerdt, Mayur Kumar, Sanket Mayekar\n\nAdvisor: [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/)\n\nDavi Aragao, Nathan Deweerdt, Mayur Kumar, and Sanket Mayekar crafted a solution for Deloitte that focuses on creating industry specific large language model (LLM) personas to enhance Deloitte’s ability to tailor strategies, communications, and products/services for effective engagement with clients. The team said, “our financial analysis indicates that our solution could save up to $1.3 million in cost savings, with more added as it scales.”\n\nThe team expressed confidence in delivering a strong prototype, comprised of a comprehensive data pipeline, a user-tailored persona and prompt generator that can be customizable based on the user’s needs, front-end web application, and a thorough evaluation process for assessing the system’s performance. The initial testing results indicate that the prototype shows great promise.\n\nPaula Payton, who was the team sponsor and head of Data Science and Survey Advisory at Deloitte said, “this team was so resourceful in terms of identifying data sources, and you certainty proved your mettle in terms of thinking very creatively about YouTube videos to find the voice of C-suite leaders.”\n\n**Circana: CPG Price Optimization**\n\nStudents: Jupiter Angulo, Josefina Bollini, Ben Cox, Ezra Kim\n\nAdvisor: Anil Chaturvedi\n\nFor their project Jupiter Angulo, Josefina Bollini, Ben Cox, and Ezra Kim worked with Circana to pioneer a framework aimed at understanding consumer behavior and willingness to pay. “The implication for manufacturers, product developers, and retailers is that they need to figure out ways to more effectively reach the consumer where they are and figure out what incentivizes consumers to purchase things,” the team said.\n\nCurrent methodologies used to achieve this task are considered old-fashioned, time consuming, and dependent on consumer surveys. The team noted that they developed a framework that is generalizable, scalable, and uses non-survey driven methods to understand the consumer preferences that Circana wanted to do a deeper dive on. The proposed methodology consists of utilizing a generalized utility model to calculate the value of attributes across multiple categories along with price elasticities using point of sale data and item attributes.\n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n\n**Argonne: Real-time Object Detection for Avian-solar Interactions**\n\nStudents: Aaron Chan, Aashish Singh, Alice Wang, Weiting Ye\n\nAdvisor: Igor Yakushin\n\n**Independent Research: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation**\n\nStudents: Nathan Pak, Tyler Roth, Isaac Silver\n\nAdvisor: Ashish Pujari",

    "page_content": "# MS in Applied Data Science Students Present Research at National Conference\n\nAs we wrap-up Autumn Quarter 2023, here's a highlight from the MS in Applied Data Science community.\n\n**Sampling Research**\n\nStudents in the MS-Applied Data Science program now have a research-focused option for their capstone experience. At a time when collaborations between industry and academia are vital for innovation and unlocking new sources of value, applied data scientists are broadening their perspective and deepening their skillsets by gaining exposure to the research side of the discipline.\n\nThe University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/how-to-apply/) has taken an important step to meet this demand by developing a new capstone track for students eager to try their hands at research.\n\nWhile the [capstone experience](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/) has traditionally involved working closely with industry partners to solve real-world business problems, the research capstone offers students an opportunity to collaborate with faculty on a leading-edge area of data science where methodologies and applications are still actively being investigated.\n\n“The area of research is the key,” says [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/), an associate clinical professor at UChicago who spearheaded the MS in Applied Data Science’s research capstone track. “We’re not conducting research on already well-studied areas but on the newest technologies where industry applications are still being worked out and discovered.”\n\nThe first batch of research projects focused on generative AI, an area that Pamuksuz says is calling out for research right now and full of opportunities for students to gain experience in research design.\n\n“Our goal is to be as up-to-the-minute as possible when it comes to teaching and sharing content with our students,” he says. “GenAI is an area still full of open questions and we saw that a research-oriented approach where faculty work directly with students as they review papers, conduct experiments, and present at academic conferences would be the best way for students to understand these technologies at a fundamental level.”\n\n**Connecting Academia to Industry**\n\nFor his part, Pamuksuz has straddled research and industry throughout his career. While earning his PhD in machine learning, he collaborated with professors in finance, marketing, and healthcare information systems to understand how these abstract methodologies connect to other disciplines.\n\n“You can do data science and use machine learning tools on virtually anything,” he says. “That’s what really caught my eye: The research side and the applied side are in constant dialogue.”\n\nHaving led data science teams at several Fortune 500 companies and co-founded the machine-learning company Inference Analytics, Pamuksuz also continues to do his own research, attend conferences, and publish in journals. He says it gives him an advantage when teaching in the Applied Data Science classroom.\n\n“I’ll show students how particular GenAI tools are being applied today, but then I’ll also highlight how the area is a live research area that’s still open to exploration and being looked at from various angles.”\n\nFor the first round of research projects, Pamuksuz and other faculty selected healthcare as the domain area. With solid data sets, innumerable potential use cases, and a positive social factor, the domain gives students an ideal instrument to more deeply understand and operationalize the foundational concepts driving the latest GenAI transformer models.\n\n“Our goal was to work with students and get them to understand these models on the most basic levels, down even to figuring out what each single neuron is doing and how they’re interacting with each other and the specific journey leading to the output. These areas are still very poorly understood today.”\n\n**PhD-Lite Experience**\n\nFor their research capstone project, Andrew Alvarez, Mary Erikson, and Tegan Keigher leveraged the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate results for CT radiology reports.\n\nWith up to fifty percent of radiologists’s time spent drafting reports today, transformer models that can automate the documenting process have the potential to save time and reduce the stress responsible for increasing burnout in recent years.\n\nHaving started their project in early 2023—just months after the groundbreaking release of ChatGPT—the team was particularly excited to dive into an area that was so timely and full of potential.\n\n“It’s been really incredible to focus on such a central topic in the world right now and dissect the nuts and bolts taking place inside it,” says Erikson, an analytical lead at Google.\n\n“At first the idea of building our own transformer model might’ve felt a little like we were biting off more than we could chew, but through reading the key research papers, learning in class, and talking with each other and Utku, we were able to get a handle on this new area and connect it with what we’d learned already in the program.”\n\nAlvarez, an engagement manager at United Airlines, says that “doing something research-based gave us an entirely new experience, one that allowed us to pick up a different sort of skillset that’s still amenable to the workplace. It was something like a PhD-lite experience.”\n\n“The capstone-related work has also helped me guide others taking their first steps into using transformer models,” Alvarez adds. “Automating areas that are putting a strain on our teams allows us to focus on the work that matters. That’s where I think these technologies will really shine.”\n\n**Frontiers of Research**\n\nA critical learning experience arrived when the team presented their research at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) as part of the [Conference on Machine Intelligence in Medical Imaging C[MIMI)](https://siim.org/learning-events/events/cmimi/).\n\nThe selective research-focused conference gave them the opportunity to mingle with top experts in the field and view firsthand what was taking place on the frontiers of research.\nPerhaps most significant were the questions the team received in response to their presentation.\n\n*Mary Erikson, Tegan Keigher, Utku Pamusuz (left to right)*\n\n*Andrew Alvarez, Mary Erikson, Conference Attendee, Tegan Keigher (left to right)*\n\n*Ananth Prayaga, Evelyn Wu, Nitin Gupta (left to right)*\n\n“They asked us if we’d tried this approach, or looked at it in this way, or pre-processed data in that way,” says Keigher, a lead data scientist at United Airlines. “Learning about these other purely research-based approaches sparked ideas for us and got us thinking about how we could improve our project and test out different avenues.”\n\nThe team is now deepening their project by incorporating what they learned at the conference. Once they finalize their results, the plan is to submit their work to the ultimate research test: a peer-reviewed publication.\n\n*By Philip Baker*",

    "page_content": "### *Sample Full-Time Schedule*\n\n#### **Prequarter** • 5 Weeks\n\nOptional\n\n* Introduction to Statistical Concepts Foundational) Optional\n  This course is held in the 5 weeks leading up to the start of your first quarter and provides general exposure to basic statistical concepts that are necessary for students to understand the content presented in more advanced courses in the program. 0 units, no cost.\n\n* R for Data Science (Foundational) Optional\n  This course is held in the 5 weeks leading up to the start of your first quarter and is an introduction to the essential concepts and techniques for the statistical computing language R. 0 units, no cost.\n\n#### **Quarter 1** • 10 Weeks\n\n* Python for Data Science (Foundational) Optional\n  This course is held concurrently with the first five weeks of your first quarter in the program and starts with an introduction to the Python programming language basic syntax and environment. 0 units, no cost.\n\n* Advanced Linear Algebra for Machine Learning (Foundational) Optional\n  If you are required to take this course it will be held concurrently with the second five weeks of your first quarter in the program. The advanced linear algebra course is focused on the theoretical concepts and real-life applications of linear algebra for machine learning. 0 units, no cost.\n\nCore\n\n* Statistical Models for Data Science Letter Grade\n  In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries. New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n* Leadership and Consulting for Data Science Letter Grade\n  Professional organizations see value in data science when it helps them to achieve their strategic goals, and the current job market likewise rewards data scientists who can use data to advance organizational interests, either as an external consultant or within internal operations teams. Data scientists can become successful (and highly marketable) leaders in today’s professional world, but they require an uncommon skill set: the strategic awareness to align data requirements with business requirements, the technical proficiency to choose a methodology appropriate to each new problem, and the communication skills to both execute the plan as part of a broader team and persuade others of their findings.\n\nCore (Choose 1)\n\n* Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing Letter Grade\n  Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market. Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data and multiple emerging software packages exist to work with it, and we will cover the most popular approaches.\n\nSeminar\n\n* Career Seminar (Required) Pass/Fail\n  The Career Seminar (Pass/Fail) supports the development of industry professional skills, job and/or internship searches, and other in-demand areas of competency among today’s employers. Students enroll in the Career Seminar each quarter in order to engage in unique content throughout their degree program. Students with significant full-time work experience may be eligible to waive this course. 0 units, no cost.\n\n#### **Quarter 2** • 10 Weeks\n\n* Machine Learning I Letter Grade\n  This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies.\n\n* Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Letter Grade\n  Time Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.\n\nElective\n\n* Elective 1 Letter Grade\n  Elective offerings vary. Students will work with their academic advisor to select electives based on their interests and course availability. A list of sample electives ([subject to change) appear at the bottom of the In-Person](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/) and [Online Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/) pages.\n\n#### **Quarter 3** • 10 Weeks\n\n* Machine Learning II Letter Grade\n  The objective of this course is three-folds–first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications.\n\n* Elective 2 Letter Grade\n  Elective offerings vary. Students will work with their academic advisor to select electives based on their interests and course availability. A list of sample electives (subject to change) appear at the bottom of the [In-Person](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/) and [Online Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/) pages.\n\nCapstone\n\n* Data Science Capstone Project Letter Grade\n  The required Capstone Project is completed over two quarters and covers research design, implementation, and writing. Full-time students start their capstone project in their third quarter.
