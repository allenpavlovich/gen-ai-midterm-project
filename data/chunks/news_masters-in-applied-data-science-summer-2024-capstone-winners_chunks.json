At the recent Summer Showcase, a diverse range of projects showcased the innovative solutions developed by these talented individuals. Six teams were particularly recognized for their exceptional work.\n\nGreg Green, Senior Instructional Professor and Director of the MS in Applied Data Science program looked back on the Capstone Showcase, stating, “The advanced AI and Data Science Capstone projects completed this summer spanned many technical areas including NLP, Computer Vision/Deep Learning, Advanced Machine Learning and Large Language Models just recently made available. We continue to be impressed not only with the advanced thinking within the technical solutions but the clarity of communication and presentation styles that make these solutions understandable to senior business leaders from a variety of domains of expertise.”\n\nOne of the Summer Capstone winners, Peerapak Adsavakulchai, observed that one key strength of his team was their diverse backgrounds. His teammates came from various fields, including trading, consulting, and data science-driven research. This diversity contributed to each team member bringing a unique perspective and skill set to the project.\n\nLearn more about the projects that won Best in Show below.",

FTI and other consulting companies, operate based on project-to-project basis and it is hard to maintain a traditional, and more efficient databases like other companies that conduct transactional businesses. A lot of the data resides in “inefficient” file types. FTI Chat, a chatbot leveraging LLMs, automates project approach creation based on client needs. FTI Chat retrieves past project data using RAG and generates responses via an open-source LLM. Due to its ease of usage, FTI Chat has the potential to become a staple product that is deployed independently where different teams can use to streamline their business development process.",

To understand the shared attributes of these two business categories and the business categories that met the award goals, this study analyzes 2023 federal contract awards using autoencoding models for dimensionality reduction and t-SNE for visualization to identify clusters. This team’s findings provide insights into which agencies and types of contracts were awarded to various small\nbusiness categories.",
