Formerly known as the MS in Analytics, the program has become a cornerstone of data science education, producing skilled professionals who drive innovation across various industries. The program is part of the [Physical Sciences Division](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/), which has a strong history of advancing new fields in physical and mathematical sciences.\n\n#### MSAppliedDataScience10thAnniversary\\_180\n\nUChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science 10th anniversary networking event at Remington’s.\nKa Yee C. Lee speaks at UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science 10th anniversary networking event at Remington’s.\nThe celebration, held at Remington’s in Chicago, brought together alumni, faculty, and industry leaders for an evening of networking and recognition. Notable speakers included [Ka Yee C. Lee](https://president.uchicago.edu/en/leadership/deans/ka-yee-c-lee), Interim Dean of the Physical Sciences Division; [David Uminsky](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/david-uminsky/), Executive Director of the Data Science Institute; program Faculty Directors [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/) and [Arnab Bose](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/arnab-bose-phd/); alumni committee members Elijah Ampo and Kshitij Mitta; and Alison Ossyra, Director of Career Services and External Partnerships. These speakers shared insights on the program’s journey and its impact on the field of data science.\n\nArnab Bose, Associate Senior Instructional Professor and Program Director of the Online Program, recalled the program’s beginnings in the windowless basement of Gleacher Center. Despite the modest setting, there was a clear vision from the start: to create a program that would lead in data science education and innovation.\n\nUChicago MS in Applied Data Science Alumni at the 10th anniversary event.\nSpeakers highlighted the program’s evolution over the past decade and its promising future. Alison Ossyra celebrated alumni achievements, while Ka Yee Lee shared a quote from a [Chicago Maroon 2013 article](https://chicagomaroon.com/17787/news/graham-offers-analytics-degree/): “It is rare that a statistics program will venture beyond the classroom setting to integrate industry data sets or case studies in the curriculum or provide students with opportunities to interact with colleagues or potential employers outside of academia.” Greg Green discussed the program’s rapid growth, with over 550 current students and 1,400 alumni, and David Uminsky emphasized the importance of the Data Science Institute’s collaboration with the program. Alumni representatives Elijah Ampo and Kshitij Mittal encouraged graduates to remain connected and involved.\n\nThe program’s success is evident not only in its numbers but also in its significant impact on alumni over the past decade. Jorge Argueta, a 2020 graduate, offered advice to prospective students: “Don’t think too much about it; just do it! It has transformed my career since I moved to Chicago and was part of the program. All the knowledge I learned in the program and brought back to my organization has helped me file my first patent, which was approved.”\n\nThis celebration marks a decade of excellence and a continued commitment to innovation and impact in the years ahead. Program faculty and staff look forward to shaping the future of data science by empowering students and alumni to make meaningful contributions to industries, communities, and research worldwide.",
