The [Capstone Project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/), the culmination of the [MS in Applied Data Science program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/how-to-apply/), brings students together with industry partners to address real-world analytics problems. The Summer Showcase featured projects across various industries, data types, and methodologies, with one team receiving special recognition.\n\n“The quality of the work was truly impressive, and the teams deserve our congratulations for their hard work, professionalism, and commitment to excellence,” said [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/), Director of the MS in Applied Data Science Program. “Their inventiveness was especially evident in the solutions they developed for their industry partners. We look forward to staying connected and hearing about the graduates’ future achievements.”\n\n*Learn more about the winning project below.*\n\n**[UChicago Medicine](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/) | Medical Language Processing – Patient Based Radiology Question & Answering System**  \n**Presenters: Ananth Prayaga, Evelyn Wu, Nitin Gupta, Vivian Yeh**  \n**Faculty Advisor: [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/)**\n\nA major challenge in healthcare is effectively utilizing the vast amount of unstructured medical data available to professionals. Without a systematic and streamlined approach, reviewing patient information requires significant time that could otherwise be spent with patients.\n\nFor their [Capstone Project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/), Ananth Prayaga, Evelyn Wu, Nitin Gupta, and Vivian Yeh addressed the labor-intensive task of reading radiology reports. They implemented a Closed Book Question-Answering (Q&A) System using the latest AI technologies to create an intelligent knowledge receiver, ContextualAI, capable of accurately answering queries without relying on external knowledge sources.\n\n“A central area of development in the generative AI field involves using LLMs to ingest site- or institution-specific data that can then be queried,” the team says. “Hospitals, financial services companies, and law firms don’t want to share their internal data with OpenAI or other AI systems due to security and privacy reasons. Our task involved creating a framework using an LLM that could ingest and query local data without compromising privacy or security.”\n\nAiming to optimize workflow efficiency, increase productivity, and reduce physician burnout, the team tested existing Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases through various approaches as they developed their framework. Two main requirements guided their solution: ingesting the unstructured data of the partner institution and teaching the LLM a new skill to process that data.\n\nUltimately, the team achieved the best results using two of [Meta’s AI tools](https://ai.meta.com/), [Llama2](https://www.llama2.ai/) and [Faiss](https://faiss.ai/index.html), which generated answers with approximately 70% accuracy, validated using patient data and human evaluations.\n\n“But we won’t stop there,” the team says. “This is a growing field and new models are being released every few weeks, so we will continue testing as new areas for improvement arise. Our client has already started to deploy our product and has expressed strong interest in further collaboration.”\n\nThe team also emphasizes the transformative potential of their project, noting its possible applications beyond healthcare. They point to a future where intelligent answers are just a question away.\n\n“This is just the beginning of what is possible and we’re really excited to see it developed further to reach its maximum potential.”",
