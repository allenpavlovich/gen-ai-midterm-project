# Master’s in Applied Data Science Autumn 2023 Capstone Winners

Using the most advanced analytics skills, MS in Applied Data Science students provide solutions for today’s urgent industry needs.

As the culmination of the [Master of Science in Applied Data Science(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program, the [Capstone Project(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/) unites students with industry partners to solve real-world analytics problems. At the Autumn Showcase—one of the largest in the history of the program—projects spanned industries, data types, and methodological approaches. Seven teams stood out for special commendation.

“The hard work, perseverance, and talent is clear from the truly impressive quality of the work,” said [Greg Green(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/), executive director for the program. “I was especially pleased to see how inventive the teams were in the solutions they developed for their industry partners.”

Learn more about the projects that won Best in Show below.

**Brief AI | Revolution in Finance**

Presenters: Jose Gerala Palacios, Vishal Parameswaran, Sanchit Narayan Kumar, Garima Sohi

Faculty Advisor: [Nick Kadochnikov(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/nick-kadochnikov/)

Project Topic: Improved efficiency for financial analysts with AI tools to analyze earnings calls. The AI tools included a fine-tuning LLM trained on earnings calls to extract Key Performance Indicators and JAVI, a chatbot that allows you to have a conversation based on any earnings call.

**Argonne National Labs | Smart Electric Vehicle Charging: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective**

Presenters: Tim Fan, Suenkei Chan, Salman Yousaf, Keerthana Adavelli

Faculty Advisor: [Gizem Aydin(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/gizem-aydim-phd/)

Project Topic: Optimized EV smart charging to minimize grid strain by using a simulated environment and dataset based on Argonne’s EV charging infrastructure. “The goal was to train and tune a reinforcement learning framework and then evaluate it in terms of energy efficiency, peak power constraints, and user satisfaction,” the team said.

**New Avenues | Increasing Efficacy of Traditional Employer-Sponsored Mental & Behavioral Support**

Presenters: Jinghong (David) He, Luxin (Lucy) Huang, Xueyao Wang, Zhen Jia (Sunny) Sun

Faculty Advisor: [Wendy Klusendorf(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/wendy-klusendorf-ms/)

Project Topic: Developed a procedure for New Avenues that accurately matched employees and their dependents within their Employee Assistance Program to appropriate mental healthcare providers. The team did this by using data-driven machine learning to develop better practices for matching patients with providers by identifying the key patient symptoms that lead to a higher level of care.

**Komatsu | Performance Evaluation of Komatsu Distributors with Telematics Data and Commodity Sales History**

Presenters: Minh Vo, Maggie Chuang, Kelsey Liu, Sakshi Shende

Faculty Advisor: [Roger Moore(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/roger-moore-mba/)

Project Topic: Komatsu is a leading global manufacturer of construction, mining, and forestry equipment, and the capstone team used machine learning models  to analyze data and improve performance evaluation of Komatsu distributors. The team also leveraged commodity sales and the telematics machine data to identify relationships between machine data and parts consumption.

**Research (Healthcare GPT) | AI Powered Radiology Report Automation**

Presenters: Mariam Adeyemo, Saloni Khandelwal, Preetika Parashar, Yun Xing, Jeniffer Dongha Lee

Faculty Advisor: [Utku Pamuksuz(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/)

Project Topic: Used AI to generate radiology reports based on findings and patient information using a large language model (LLM) trained on MRI and ultrasound data from UChicago Medicine. “This will greatly assist radiologists by advancing the automation of the documentation process,” the team said.

**Research (Healthcare GPT) | Decoder-Only Computed Tomography Radiology Reports (DOCTRR)**

Presenters: Tegan Keigher, Mary Erikson, Andrew Alvarez

Faculty Advisor: [Utku Pamuksuz(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/)

Project Topic: Harnessed the potential of large language models to automatically generate accurate findings sections of CT radiology reports as this is a challenging task demanding substantial time and effort from radiologists. “Our vector-to-sequence model was in the end capable of producing radiology reports with a level of accuracy and quality comparable to that of human physicians,” the team said.

**US Ignite | US Ignite National Broadband Tool**

Presenters: Kishor Kumar Reddy, Shweta Sampath Kumar, Swathi Ganesan, Marc Edwards

Faculty Advisor: [Don Patchell(https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/)

Project Topic: Developed AI tool to predict economic impact of broadband access and write data- and insight-driven grant proposals to apply for and secure government funds. The capstone sponsor works with communities, businesses, local governments, and federal agencies to aid community leaders in securing funding and effectively managing broadband transformation projects. Existing studies have shown that nearly one-third of U.S. cities lack access to fast, reliable internet and that closing this gap would improve economic opportunities in those areas while also improving the quality of life for their populations.
