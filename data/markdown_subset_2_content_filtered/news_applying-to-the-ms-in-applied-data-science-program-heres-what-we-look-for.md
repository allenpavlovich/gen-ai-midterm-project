# Applying to the MS in Applied Data Science Program? Here’s What We Look For

Before you submit your MS in Applied Data Science application, explore some key traits we look for in our candidates.

Thinking about applying to the [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program at the University of Chicago? We’re thrilled to have you here! Our program is designed for ambitious problem-solvers ready to make a difference in fields ranging from healthcare to finance and beyond. To help you put your best foot forward, we’re sharing a few key traits we look for in applicants. Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist looking to level up your career or considering a career switch to data science, here’s what you need to know to stand out and succeed.

**Trait #1: Some Prior Experience with Python or R**

Let’s start with the basics. No, we don’t need you to be a coding wizard (though, if you are, that’s awesome!). But you should have dabbled a bit in Python or R. What does that mean? If someone says, “Download this library in Jupyter Notebook,” you shouldn’t be scratching your head. Instead, you should be nodding along, maybe even excited to try it out.

Know your data types—strings, Booleans, integers, floats, all that jazz. And if you’ve played around with data frames or created some basic data visualizations, you’re on the right track.

If this sounds foreign, don’t panic! There are great resources to help you get up to speed without breaking the bank. Daniel Truesdale, one of our own, started with the Coursera course “[Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python).” He also honed his skills through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) competitions.

In short, you don’t need a technical background, but some familiarity with Python or R is key.

**Trait #2: Collaboration is Key**

Our students are movers and shakers, ready to make an impact in tech, finance, sports, media, healthcare, education, government, logistics—you name it. Transitioning from theory to real-world impact means working well with others. We look for students who are:

* **Team Players**: You’re comfortable working alongside people from different backgrounds and perspectives.
* **Community Builders**: You want to be part of our community, help build it, and stay connected even after graduation.

You’ll learn a lot from our faculty, but also from your classmates. Grad school is as much about building your network as it is about hitting the books.

**Trait #3: Be Authentic**

Just be yourself. We don’t expect you to be a master of math, statistics, and programming before you even start (otherwise, why would you need us?). Be open about where you need to grow, but also proud of what you bring to the table.

Authenticity goes a long way. It helps us understand who you are and how you’ll fit into and contribute to our community.

So, if you’re thinking about applying, keep these traits in mind. We can’t wait to see what you’ll bring to the University of Chicago!

**Trait #4: Relax and communicate effectively**

Students must submit a video recording of themselves answering one question as part of their application requirements, a second video prompt is optional. Practice presenting in front of the camera and review the video before submitting. Make sure you are speaking loudly and calmly. We encourage students to not read off of a script so you do not sound robotic. This is a chance for students to show their personality and effective communication skills. Also, it is recommended for students to treat the video requirement as if they are interviewing for a position; professional attire is encouraged.

Presenting is common in our program, don’t worry if it’s not perfect as students will have plenty of opportunities to practice in the program.
