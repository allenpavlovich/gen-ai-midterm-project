# Schmidt Faculty Fellows

A program that supports faculty at Nigerian universities interested in applying AI methodology to address significant research questions in the natural sciences and engineering.

The [AI in Science Faculty Fellowship](https://aiscience.uchicago.edu/faculty-fellows/), a program of Schmidt Sciences at the University of Chicago, will host junior faculty at Nigerian universities interested in advancing and accelerating the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the natural sciences. Faculty Fellows are offered freedom and independence in pursuing their AI-related research, including the flexibility to change or expand their research focus and work with multiple research groups at the University. In addition, Faculty Fellows receive focused training in AI/ML methods relevant to their research and work collaboratively with their Nigerian and American colleagues on their chosen projects. Upon their return to Nigeria, Faculty Fellows teach students and their colleagues the computational skills they have acquired while at the University of Chicago. This bi-directional exchange program is complemented by the allocation of computational resources at the University of Chicago that are available to Expansion Fellows both during their training and after returning to Nigeria. This program presents a unique opportunity for Faculty Fellows to become the leaders of Africa’s AI in Science movement.

This program is an extension of the Schmidt Postdoctoral Fellowship Program and leverages existing programming. Faculty Fellows participate in training activities, seminars, conferences, workshops, etc. They form a cohort of top scholars across the natural sciences and join an active and growing AI and science community that includes departments across the UChicago campus as well as [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/), [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www.fnal.gov/), the [NSF-Simons National Institute for Theory and Mathematics in Biology](https://www.nitmb.org/), and the [NSF-Simons AI Institute for the Sky](https://skai-institute.github.io/).
