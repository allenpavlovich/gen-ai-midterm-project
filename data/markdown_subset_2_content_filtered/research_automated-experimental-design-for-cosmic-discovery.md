# Automated Experimental Design for Cosmic Discovery

Brian Nord, and Yuxin Chen

Use AI to automate the design, optimization and forecasting of cosmic survey experiments.

This project aims to lay the foundations for next-generation cosmic experimental design backed by new artificial intelligence and machine learning methods tailored to cosmology. The collaboration brings together computer scientists and astrophysicists working to understand how data and computation can inform and accelerate cosmic survey design, taking into account previous data, the capabilities of contemporary computational approaches, and insights from the underlying physics.

A distinguishing aspect of the project is its end-to-end focus, going from simulation to real cosmic survey in a closed loop. The work weaves together advances in deep learning, high-dimensional/nonparametric statistics, discrete optimization, and information theory; the developed methodologies will be validated in simulated environments, eventually leading to a new future cosmic experiment which will be evaluated against existing designs by Fermilab.

*This project was funded by the AI + Science initiative, a program organized by the University of Chicago [Office of Research and National Laboratories](https://researchinnovation.uchicago.edu/) in collaboration with the Center for Data and Computing aimed at increasing interactions among the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.*

Principal Investigators: Brian Nord (Fermilab), Yuxin Chen (UChicago)

[![This image is packed full of galaxies! A keen eye can spot exquisite ellipticals and spectacular spirals, seen at various orientations: edge-on with the plane of the galaxy visible, face-on to show off magnificent spiral arms, and everything in between. The vast majority of these specks are galaxies, but to spot a foreground star from our own galaxy, you can look for a point of light with tell-tale diffraction spikes. The most alluring subject sits at the centre of the frame. With the charming name of SDSSJ0146-0929, the glowing central bulge is a galaxy cluster  a monstrous collection of hundreds of galaxies all shackled together in the unyielding grip of gravity. The mass of this galaxy cluster is large enough to severely distort the spacetime around it, creating the odd, looping curves that almost encircle the cluster. These graceful arcs are examples of a cosmic phenomenon known as an Einstein ring. The ring is created as the light from a distant objects, like galaxies, pass by an extremely large mass, like this galaxy cluster. In this image, the light from a background galaxy is diverted and distorted around the massive intervening cluster and forced to travel along many different light paths towards Earth, making it seem as though the galaxy is in several places at once.](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/41396796925_f9916b2f16_b-750x500.jpg)
