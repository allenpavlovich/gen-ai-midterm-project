Aaron Dinner is a Professor of Chemistry and Deputy Dean of the Physical Sciences Division at the University of Chicago. He obtained his A.B. in Biochemical Sciences in 1994 and his Ph.D. in Biophysics in 1999 both from Harvard University. Following postdoctoral research at Oxford University from 1999 to 2001 and University of California Berkeley from 2001 to 2003 he joined the faculty at the University of Chicago in 2003.From 2012 to 2018 he served as the Director of the James Franck Institute — a longstanding interdisciplinary institute bringing together research in condensed matter physics, atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics, biophysics, and physical chemistry.. His research seeks to understand how the complex behaviors of living systems arise from molecular interactions, and he pioneered machine learning methods for interpreting molecular dynamics simulations. His honors include a Searle Scholarship, National Science Foundation CAREER Award, Sloan Fellowship, and an American Physical Society Fellowship.
