**Abstract:** In the quest to meet escalating energy demands, the development of batteries  
boasting significantly higher energy densities than current lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is  
paramount. Next-generation batteries (NGB) such as lithium metal battery emerge as a  
compelling candidate, offering energy densities up to tenfold higher. However, the  
commercialization of most NGBs is hindered by electrolytes exhibiting poor compatibility with  
highly reactive lithium metal. My research at the University of Chicago focuses on addressing  
this daunting challenge through the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning  
(AI/ML). By employing a forward design methodology, which maps molecular structures and  
experimental conditions to electrolyte properties, my work advances the discovery of  
electrolytes that can meet the stringent and disparate requirements of such NGBs. This AI/ML-  
centric approach combining experiments and simulations is pivotal for bringing a paradigm shift  
in global energy landscape. Finally, I will outline some of our future directions that includes  
coupling a self-driven robotic platform with existing AI/ML tools to expedite the fabrication and  
testing of battery materials.

**!Bio:** Dr. Ritesh Kumar received his doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in materials science from Indian Institute of Science, India in 2022, with his dissertation formulating robust strategies for designing efficient functional materials using quantum chemistry-based methods and ML  
algorithms. He joined the University of Chicago as a postdoctoral scholar at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering under Prof. Chibueze Amanchukwu in 2022 before transitioning to the position of Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow in 2023. His research interests span wide areas of materials informatics aimed at developing novel materials, at the intersection of physics, chemistry, materials science, computational modeling, data science. He also holds a M.S. in Chemical Sciences from the Indian Institute of Science (2017) and a B.Sc.
