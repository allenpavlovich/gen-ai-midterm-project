Research Initiative

# Complementary AI

Exploring how to train AI models that augment rather than mimic human capacity.

The notion of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that computationally mimics human intelligence has dominated the design of computational intelligence, but is tuned to replace humanity rather than augment its capacity. Rather than targeting Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we argue that AI should be designed to complement individual and collective human capacity, avoid humanity’s blind spots, overcome cognitive and cultural limitations, and unleash novel senses, skills, and imagination.

This initiative addresses new and complex questions regarding how to build AI models without targeting but rather expanding human capacity. This research initiative will integrate with social and behavioral sciences to identify and monitor changing human limitations and opportunities. It will also draw on business and economics to measure and model human-AI productivity; legal and policy expertise to propose models by which AI can assist in the regulation of other AI; and tools and insight across the sciences, engineering, arts, and humanities to align AI with human needs and values. These efforts will grow human-AI potential to grapple with the greatest challenges facing humanity together.

My research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture—novelty, ambiguity, topology—of understanding. I am especially interested in innovation—how new ideas and practices emerge—and the role that social and technical institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations) play in collective cognition and discovery. Much of my work has focused on areas of modern science and technology, but I am also interested in other domains of knowledge—news, law, religion, gossip, hunches, machine and historical modes of thinking and knowing. I support the creation of novel observatories for human understanding and action through crowd sourcing, information extraction from text and images, and the use of distributed sensors (e.g., RFID tags, cell phones). I use machine learning, generative modeling, social and semantic network representations to explore knowledge processes, scale up interpretive and field-methods, and create alternatives to current discovery regimes.

My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Air Force office of Science Research, and many philanthropic sources, and has been published in *Nature*, *Science*, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Science*, *American Journal of Sociology*, *American Sociological Review*, *Social Studies of Science*, *Research Policy, Critical Theory,**Administrative Science Quarterly*, and other outlets. My work has been featured in the *Economist*, *Atlantic Monthly*, *Wired*, *NPR*, *BBC*, *El País*, *CNN, Le Monde,*and many other outlets.

At Chicago, I am Director of [Knowledge Lab](http://www.knowledgelab.org/), which has collaborative, granting and employment opportunities, as well as ongoing seminars. I also founded and now direct on the Computational Social Science program at Chicago, and sponsor an associated Computational Social Science workshop. I teach courses in augmented intelligence, the history of modern science, science studies, computational content analysis, and Internet and Society. Before Chicago, I received my doctorate in sociology from Stanford University, served as a research associate in the Negotiation, Organizations, and Markets group at Harvard Business School, started a private high school focused on project-based arts education, and completed a B. A. in Anthropology at Brigham Young University.
