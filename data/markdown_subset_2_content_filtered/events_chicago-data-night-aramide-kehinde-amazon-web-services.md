**Abstract:** AI’s evolution continues to create a paradigm change in the way we work and the things data professionals build. Two foundational things remain the same for creating meaningful results –  knowing the “why” behind the work and having core skillset. Learn how honing these two things can help to create results through real life scenarios in Media & Entertainment, and Health and Wellbeing.
