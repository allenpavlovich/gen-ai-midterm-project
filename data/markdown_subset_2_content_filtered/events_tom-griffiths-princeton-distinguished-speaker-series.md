# Tom Griffiths (Princeton): Distinguished Speaker Series

Mapping the heterogeneity of artificial intelligence using the tools of cognitive science

May 6, 2025 11:30 AM – 1:00 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 390

*Part of the [2025 Distinguished Speaker Series.](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/2024-25-distinguished-speaker-series/)*

The University of Chicago Data Science Institute, Department of Statistics, Department of Computer Science, and Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics are proud to announce our 2025 Distinguished Speaker Series. Join us for stimulating talks from leading data science researchers exploring and expanding the fundamental methods and approaches that transform large and complex datasets into knowledge and action.

**Abstract:**Rapid progress in artificial intelligence research has led many to predict that we will soon have superhuman artificial general intelligences. I will argue that a more realistic outcome is that we will create systems that are heterogeneously superintelligent, outperforming humans in a wide range of settings but also systematically underperforming in others. I will also argue that the tools we need for understanding this heterogeneity can be found in cognitive science, where researchers have spent decades developing theoretical and empirical methods for making sense of the capabilities of intelligent systems. I will illustrate this argument by discussing some surprising cases where large language models perform poorly in predictable ways (“embers of autoregression”) and recent results showing that both the classic phenomenon of neural networks being insufficiently discrete and the classic phenomenon of thought being overly discrete result in deficits in the performance of fielded AI systems.

**Bio:** [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php) is the Henry R. Luce Professor of Information Technology, Consciousness and Culture in the Departments of Psychology and Computer Science at Princeton University, where he is also the Director of the new AI Lab. His research explores connections between human and machine learning, using ideas from statistics and artificial intelligence to understand how people solve the challenging computational problems they encounter in everyday life. He has made contributions to the development of Bayesian models of cognition, probabilistic machine learning, nonparametric Bayesian statistics, and models of cultural evolution, and his recent work has demonstrated how methods from cognitive science can shed light on modern artificial intelligence systems. Tom completed his PhD in Psychology at Stanford University in 2005, and taught at Brown University and the University of California, Berkeley before moving to Princeton. He has received awards for his research from organizations ranging from the American Psychological Association to the National Academy of Sciences and is a co-author of the book Algorithms to Live By, introducing ideas from computer science and cognitive science to a general audience.
