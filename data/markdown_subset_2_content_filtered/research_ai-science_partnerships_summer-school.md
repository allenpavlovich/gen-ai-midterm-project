# Summer School

The goal of this yearly program is to introduce a new generation of diverse interdisciplinary graduate students and researchers to the emerging field of AI+Science.

## 2025 AI+Science Summer School

Following a successful AI+Science Summer School in 2022, 2023, and 2024 with a total of 208 participants from 66 research institutions and industry, the [2025 AI+Science Summer School](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/events/aiscience-summer-school-2025/) will be held from June 30 to July 4, 2025 at the University of Chicago John W Boyer Center in Paris, France. It is jointly hosted by the [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://aiscience.uchicago.edu/) program at the University of Chicago (a Schmidt Futures program), the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) [Center on AI for Science and Science for AI (AISSAI)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://aissai.cnrs.fr/en/__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!5h2DHNkdGPkaxjaCYur-gw5IsIBaclt1dwrbjUzjtBIJzLqCDnjhaH2PgbdEMooZ05SQHGJtBQNDash6lKaot0V_$), and the [University of Chicago Data Science Institute](http://datascience.uchicago.edu/). The goal of this yearly program is to introduce a new generation of diverse interdisciplinary graduate students and researchers to the emerging field of AI+Science. We also hope this program can build community and spur new research directions focused on AI-enabled scientific discovery across the physical and biological sciences.
