# MS in Applied Data Science shares career advice with Stagg High School students

Daniel Truesdale, Assistant Director of Enrollment Management for MS in Applied Data Science, participated in Stagg’s careers day to raise interest in Data Science

On February 6th, students from [Amos Alonzo Stagg High School](https://www.d230.org/stagg) wandered the tables of their career fair, exploring post-grad opportunities. “I didn’t know what Data Science even was before coming. Now I am considering it as an option for me after high school,” remarked one student after talking with Daniel Truesdale.

[Truesdale](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/daniel-truesdale/) attended the career fair for approximately 2500 students to share educational opportunities offered through the DSI, such as [Summer Lab](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/) and the [Data4All](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/data4all/) programs. He estimated that he spoke with nearly fifty students about what data science is and how to explore career paths in the field.

Teacher Jonathan McGreal had only praise for the turnout, remarking “As a representative of UChicago, Mr. Truesdale did a great job highlighting the skillset, workload, and job outlook for Data Science. The students have a much better understanding about this booming field!”

Truesdale focused his discussions with students on how to get started in a [career in Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/), as well as pointing students to training resources and programs. “I feel like this is part of the university’s mission,” said Truesdale. “To reach out to the local community and participate in meeting their needs.”

Although the 2024 Summer Lab application has closed, students still have time to apply for the [Data4All](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/data4all/) program. It engages high school students in high-level data and coding challenges, with the goal to create a continuous, evolving computer science pathway for students, allowing them to smoothly transition from the basics of computing through high school to college and beyond.

[Applications](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrR2H6RKtJV5x0j0gKqtZOgaBHjHIqvTjxBohsS6Sar0-1vA/viewform) for the Spring 2024 Data4All program are due Friday, February 23rd.
