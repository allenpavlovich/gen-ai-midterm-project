Research Initiative

AI + Science

A new paradigm of transformational AI-enabled scientific discovery across the physical and biological sciences, advancing core AI principles and training a new generation of diverse interdisciplinary scientists.

!

## Overview

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) will fundamentally change the nature and pace of scientific discovery. Widespread adoption of AI in the sciences has the potential to integrate scientific inquiry with modes of hypothesis generation, data analysis, simulation, and testing that will transform our capacity to address scientific problems that currently appear intractable.
