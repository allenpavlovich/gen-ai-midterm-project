# Arvind Krishnan

Undergraduate, The University of Chicago

**Project:**Developing RNAseq Pipelines

**Mentors:**[Jean-Baptiste Reynier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-baptiste-reynier/) & [Anna Woodard](https://github.com/annawoodard), [Olopade](http://med-faculty.bsd.uchicago.edu/Default/Details/2807) Lab

**Research Area Keywords:** Medicine & Health // Scientific Computing // Systems

**Project Description:**Arvind Krishnan is a senior at the University of Chicago studying molecular engineering and biological sciences. This summer, they worked with [Jean-Baptiste Reynier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-baptiste-reynier/) and [Anna Woodard](https://labs.globus.org/people.html) in the [Olopade Lab](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/olufunmilayo-i-olopade) on a project that consisted of creating a pipeline to analyze RNAseq data composed of sequenced mRNA from breast cancer patients. The pipeline generates an expression profile, uses this to classify tumors into their subtypes, as well as quantify the immune cell types in the microenvironment of the tumor.
