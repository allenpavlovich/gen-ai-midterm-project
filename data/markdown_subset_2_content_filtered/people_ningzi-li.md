# Ningzi Li

Professional Research Specialist, Data Science Institute; Adjunct Assistant Professor, Booth School of Business

Ningzi Li is a Professional Research Specialist at the Data Science Institute & Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Booth School of Business. She applies natural language processing and natural experiments to understanding communication and behavior in business organizations. Her current work particularly theorizes how firms use language as a strategy to influence stakeholder behaviors in the context of earnings calls, venture capital investments, and sustainability reports. She additionally studies how language from stakeholders shapes firm behaviors through culture and reputation in the context of employee reviews and product recalls. Previously, Ningzi served as a postdoctoral fellow at the Data Science Institute, University of Chicago and a research associate at the Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado Boulder. She earned her PhD in Sociology from Cornell University.
