# Isaac Mehlhaff

Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science, Texas A&M University

DSI Postdoctoral Scholar 2023-2024

Isaac Mehlhaff joined DSI as a postdoctoral scholar in August 2023. His research is driven by substantive questions in public opinion and political psychology: How and why do citizens change their attitudes on political issues? How do these attitude changes drive mass polarization? How is polarization causally related to other features of government and society? He investigates these questions by using and developing methods in natural language processing, Bayesian statistics, and causal inference, with a particular focus on high-quality measurement.

Isaac was part of the Data & Democracy initiative at DSI, with the goal of developing and deploying flexible chatbots to study political communication, persuasion, and misinformation. He holds a PhD and MA in political science from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a BA in history, political science, and economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
