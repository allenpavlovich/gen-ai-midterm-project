#### ***The first AI + Science Summer School was a huge success! Join [the DSI newsletter](http://eepurl.com/gfJPtT) for announcements about next year’s program.***

Modern artificial intelligence and machine learning will fundamentally change scientific discovery. We are just beginning to understand the possibilities presented by an era of extraordinarily powerful computers coupled with advanced instruments capable of collecting enormous volumes of high-resolution experimental data. Off-the-shelf machine learning tools cannot fully extract the knowledge contained in these datasets, let alone generate new theories and propose future experiments.

The [AI + Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/) Summer School was an August 2022 event jointly hosted by the Data Science Institute (DSI) and [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/) (IMSI) at the University of Chicago. It focused on four core themes at the heart of this emerging paradigm of scientific discovery: AI uncovering new laws of nature, AI guiding scientific measurement, physics-informed machine learning, and scientific discovery advancing AI frontiers.

Speakers and talks at the summer school included (click link to watch video):

* Christoph Ortner – “[Atomic Cluster Expansion – A Framework For Modeling Equivariant Properties Of Atoms And Molecules](https://youtu.be/b_pCIBmxco8)“

* Eric Jonas – “[Sampling Methods For High-Dimensional Distributions](https://youtu.be/UtnG3x-LmTY)“

The goal of the program is to introduce a new generation of diverse interdisciplinary graduate students and researchers to the emerging field of AI + Science. We also hope this program can build community and spur new research directions focused on AI-enabled scientific discovery across the physical and biological sciences.

## Speakers

! 

# Camille Avestruz

Assistant Professor of Physics, University of Michigan

Dr. Avestruz's research interests span astrophysics, cosmology, and computation. Dr. Avestruz uses simulations to make robust predictions and interpretations of observations of large-scale cosmic structure. Her primary focus is to understand the evolution of clusters of galaxies, the most massive gravitationally collapsed structures in our universe, comprised of hundreds to thousands of galaxies. Other aspects of her work prepare for the next decade of observations, which will produce unprecedented volumes of data. Dr. Avestruz incorporates big data methods, including machine learning, to extract gravitational lensing signatures that probe the mass distribution of massive galaxies and galaxy clusters.

Dr. Avestruz is passionate about making STEM accessible to those who have been historically excluded from the sciences and the academy. She has taught software and computation workshops to a variety of audiences ranging from undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) groups to societies promoting the advancement of underrepresented minorities in STEM. She has also engaged in public outreach, believing that intellectual exchange is not and should not be isolated within the walls and members of higher education. This includes teaching labs to students from local middle and high schools and giving public talks at Astronomy on Tap and to underserved elderly communities.

# Miles Stoudenmire

Research Scientist, CCQ, Flatiron Institute

Miles Stoudenmire joined the Flatiron Institute in 2017 as a research scientist at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ). He earned a B.S. in physics and math from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2005 and a Ph.D. in physics from the University of California Santa Barbara in 2010. He held postdoctoral and research scientist positions at the University of California Irvine and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics.

Miles’ speciality is using tensor networks, a technique for compressing and manipulating large collections of parameters encountered in quantum mechanics and in machine learning. A key area of his research is expanding the reach of tensor networks to include more detailed and realistic aspects of quantum systems, such as the use of chemically accurate basis sets and the inclusion of finite temperature effects.

Miles is also the lead developer of the ITensor software for tensor network calculations. The ITensor interface allows users to directly transcribe tensor network diagrams into efficient code, and is very useful for rapidly prototyping new algorithms.
