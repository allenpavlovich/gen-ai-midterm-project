**Abstract:**  The primary role of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is to defend an organization against threats such as hacking and other types of electronic fraud/malfeasance. Due to a confluence of technological and human factors many organizations face a new set of cybersecurity threats that don’t neatly fit into a CISO’s current job description. Such threats include insider leaks, intellectual property theft, and AI manipulated inauthentic data — attacks that target or use privileged “knowledge” rather than device or data compromise. I will talk about the growing severity of knowledge-based attacks and the technical solutions developed in a new startup.

!**Bio:** **Sanjay Krishnan** is an Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago and Head of Research at EchoMark Inc. He has a number of publications, awards, patents, and serves on the organization committees of SIGMOD and VLDB. He received his PhD from UC Berkeley in 2018 and a BS/MS in 2012.
