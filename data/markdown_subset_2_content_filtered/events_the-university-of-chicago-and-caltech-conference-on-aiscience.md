The University of Chicago and the California Institute of Technology are centers of gravity for the study, application, and use of AI and Machine Learning to enable scientific discovery across the physical and biological sciences, advancing core AI principles and training a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists. To both advance this scientific and technical pursuit and demonstrate the leadership of UChicago and Caltech in this space, we will host *The University of Chicago and Caltech Conference on AI+Science, Sponsored by the Margot and Thomas Pritzker Family Foundation*, in Chicago from **March 28 – 30, 2023**. This event will bring together an elite and diverse cohort of leading researchers in core AI and domain sciences to lead conversations and drive partnerships that will shape future inquiry, industry investment, and entrepreneurial opportunities.
