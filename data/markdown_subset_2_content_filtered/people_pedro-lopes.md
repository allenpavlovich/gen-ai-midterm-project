# Pedro Lopes

Assistant Professor, Computer Science

Pedro Lopes is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where he leads the Human Computer Integration lab. Lopes’ research group focuses understanding how to integrate computer interfaces with the human body—creating the interface paradigm that supersedes wearable computing. They created wearable muscle stimulation devices that enable, for example, to: a user to manipulate a tool they never seen before, accelerate our reaction time, read and write information without using a screen, and transform someone’s arm into a plotter so they can solve complex problems with pen and paper. Their work is published at top-tier conferences (ACM CHI, ACM UIST, Cerebral Cortex). Pedro and his students have received one Best Paper award, three Best Talk Awards and two Best Paper nominations. Their work also captured the interest of media, such as MIT Technology Review, NBC, Discovery Channel, NewScientist, Wired and has been shown at Ars Electronica and World Economic Forum.
