**Abstract:** In the development of materials for realistic applications, the detection and understanding of atomic and electronic structures, especially of defects, interfaces, and nanostructures, is paramount. Advances characterization via electron, x-ray, and atom probes, in imaging, scattering, and spectroscopic modes, have brought us closer to such detection and understanding. However, such experimental data is often difficult to parse and relate to fundamental understanding of mechanisms and behavior at the atomic level. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts in MaterialEyes to use AI/ML and theoretical modeling to enable the seeing of atomic structures from experimental characterization data. I will also discuss our work in using AI to extract and use microscopy and spectroscopy data from scientific literature.

**!Bio: Maria Chan** is a scientist at the Center for Nanoscale Materials at Argonne National Laboratory who studies nanomaterials and renewable energy materials, including solar cells, batteries, thermoelectrics, and catalysts. Her particular focus is on using artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) for efficient materials property prediction and for interfacing modeling with x-ray, electron, and scanning probe characterization. She also works on using AI for extracting microscopy and spectroscopy data from scientific literature and for microscopy data management.

Chan is a senior fellow at the [Northwestern Argonne Institute for Science and Engineering](https://www.naise.northwestern.edu/people/), and a fellow of the [University of Chicago Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering](https://researchinnovation.uchicago.edu/research-support/case/). She is an associate editor at the [ACS Journal Chemistry of Materials](https://pubs.acs.org/page/cmatex/editors.html), a member of the [Condensed Matter and Materials Research Committee](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/condensed-matter-and-materials-research-committee-formerly-the-solid-state-sciences-committee) of the National Academies of Sciences, and serves on the advisory boards for the journal [APL-Machine Learning](https://publishing.aip.org/publications/journals/apl-machine-learning/), [Duke’s aiM-NRT AI training project](https://aim-nrt.pratt.duke.edu/), and [CEDARS EFRC](https://www.ncat.edu/news/2022/08/kumar-doe-cedars-grant.php). She was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2024.
