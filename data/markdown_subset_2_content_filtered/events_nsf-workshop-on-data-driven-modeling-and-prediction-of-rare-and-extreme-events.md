### Overview

This workshop will convene experts in rare and extreme event detection and characterization representing a broad range of application domains and disciplines, including statistics, machine learning, applied mathematics, space weather, materials science, and climate modeling. The goal is for these experts with complementary backgrounds to identify key challenges and opportunities, with an emphasis on methodologies that may be leveraged across domains. The focus on data-driven methods encompasses recent efforts in machine learning, including physics-informed machine learning and generative models, and how such tools may advance rare and extreme event forecasting. The agenda will also include physics-driven approaches, including simulations, both as a source of fundamental insights into the modeling of rare events and as a mechanism for generating data to complement real-world data used to train data-driven models. This two-day workshop will be held at the University of Chicago on November 21-22, 2024. It will feature lectures from experts across the spectrum of disciplines listed above, panel discussions, poster sessions, and lightning talks.

### Workshop theme and goals

The detection, characterization, and forecasting of rare events play critical roles in many science and engineering settings, including non-destructive testing of materials, space weather and climate forecasting, tipping points in ecological systems, and cascading series of failures in the power grid. In these and other applications, there is growing interest in using data-driven methods (e.g., machine learning) to increase accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. However, many off-the-shelf machine learning tools are ill-suited to the modeling and prediction of rare events *because* they are rare. For instance, a classifier may misclassify all rare events and still have high average accuracy, and generative models may fail to generate samples in the tails of distributions underlying training data. Such failures may not impact standard performance metrics appreciably, but have a heavy impact on downstream scientific inquiry and engineering efforts. In parallel, sophisticated simulation systems provide unique opportunities for methods of the interface of simulation and machine learning. A key objective of the workshop is to develop an understanding of how we can ensure data-driven methods are sensitive to and even exploit rare and extreme events, leverage physical models and simulators, and facilitate the prediction of future incipient failures (e.g., aircraft vulnerabilities or space weather impacts). 

**The goal of this workshop** **is to identify existing tools, open problems, and research opportunities for forecasting and characterizing rare extreme events using data-driven methods.** Our focus with this workshop is on mechanisms that *detect, predict, and characterize* rare and extreme events.
