# Jiwen Fan

Deputy Division Director, Environmental Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory; UChicago CASE Senior Scientist Affiliate; Faculty Co-Director, AI for Climate

[Dr. Jiwen Fan](https://www.anl.gov/profile/jiwen-fan) is the Deputy Division Director and Senor Earth Scientist of the Environmental Science Division. She also holds a joint appointment as a senior scientist at University of Chicago. She is a Fellow of American Meteorological Society (AMS).

Dr. Fan’s research encompasses atmospheric chemistry and aerosols, cloud physics, convective systems, severe weather, aerosol-precipitation-climate interactions, land-atmosphere interactions, and human-earth system interactions. Her primary foci in recent years include the impacts of environmental (e.g., urbanization, anthropogenic aerosols, wildfires) and climate change on convective storms and weather hazards and model developments of cloud microphysics and aerosol-cloud interactions.

Pertaining to AICE, she has been working with data scientists to develop machine learning models for predicting precipitation and hail, analyzing observational data, and building ML emulators for complex cloud microphysical processes.
