[**The Rising Stars in Data Science workshop**](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/event/rising-stars-in-data-science-workshop-autumn-2024/), hosted **November 14-15** by the University of California San Diego in collaboration with the University of Chicago and Stanford University, **focuses on celebrating and fast tracking the careers of exceptional data scientists** at a critical inflection point in their career: the transition to postdoctoral scholar, research scientist, industry research position, or tenure track position. Over the past four years, the Rising Stars workshop has hosted over 130 Rising Stars from nearly 40 institutions.

This fall, the fifth annual Rising Stars workshop will showcase the exciting, innovative data science initiatives at UC San Diego, UChicago and Stanford University. This event will provide PhD students and postdocs the opportunity to plug into these networks, platforms, and opportunities. The workshop also aims to increase representation and diversity in data science by providing a platform and a supportive mentoring network to **navigate academic careers in data science**. All graduate students and postdocs, including those who belong to groups underrepresented in data science, are encouraged to apply, including but not limited to people of all racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, sexual orientations, genders, and persons with disabilities.

The two-day workshop will feature career and research panels, networking and mentoring opportunities, and research talks from the Rising Stars. Participants will gain insights from faculty panels on career development questions such as: how to start your academic career in data science; how to strategically sustain your career through research collaborations, publications, and skill development; and how to form meaningful interdisciplinary collaborations in data science with industry and government partners. Participants will also hear inspiring keynote talks from established, cutting-edge leaders in data science.
