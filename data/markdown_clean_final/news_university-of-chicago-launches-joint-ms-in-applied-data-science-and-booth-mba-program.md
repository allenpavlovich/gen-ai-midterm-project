# University of Chicago Launches Joint MS in Applied Data Science and Booth MBA Program

The University of Chicago launched a new joint-degree program that combines a MBA from the Booth School of Business with a MS in Applied Data Science from the Physical Sciences Division and Data Science Institute. With access to cutting-edge research, networking opportunities, and world-class resources, students in the program will be well-prepared to tackle the challenges of today’s data-driven and artificial intelligence business landscape.

Students enrolled in the joint program will take a blend of courses from both Booth and the MS in Applied Data Science curriculum. This includes:

* 14 MBA courses at Booth
* 9 data science courses
* Leadership Effectiveness and Development (LEAD)
* A Qualified Work Experience, which is a noncredit professional internship

“What drew me to the combined program was the opportunity to complement the technical and soft skills acquired through a traditional MBA at Booth, with the ability to deeply understand and succeed in our increasingly data-driven world,” says incoming student Victor Doddy, who is coming from Washington, D.C. “I was also drawn by the opportunity to meet and learn from professors on the cutting edge of business, research, and technology, and from other Master’s students in both programs individually, as well in the joint program.” Doddy earned his Bachelor’s degree in Economics from the University of Chicago.

For students like Doddy, this new program offers students the opportunity to develop in-demand leadership skills while mastering advanced data science techniques, all integrated with a comprehensive business education. This combination will help graduate students stand out in highly competitive industries such as finance, healthcare, technology, and consulting.

One of the program’s standout features is its flexibility. Booth MBA courses are taken in person, allowing students to immerse themselves in the collaborative environment of one of the world’s leading business schools. MS in Applied Data Science courses are delivered online, enabling students to balance both degrees.

!For Aneesha Dasari, another incoming student in the joint program, the intersection of data science and business is a career-defining opportunity. Originally from Alpharetta, Georgia, Dasari earned her Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Vanderbilt University. “I’ve worked in tech and management consulting for five years, and I have found that my interests are deeply rooted in the overlap of data science, healthcare, and business,” she explains. “The UChicago Booth MBA and MS in Applied Data Science provide the perfect opportunity to explore all three. After graduation, I aim to pivot into the healthcare industry and be involved in the decision-making and change-making for health data solutions, hopefully finding a way to benefit children’s healthcare specifically.”

For students like Dasari, the program serves as a springboard for applying data science to solve real-world problems in industries like healthcare. Her aim to pivot into healthcare is an example of how students can use their joint degree to lead meaningful change in their fields.

The UChicago joint MBA/MS in Applied Data Science program offers a unique blend of business acumen and data science mastery, positioning graduates to be leaders in an evolving digital landscape. Whether pursuing roles in business strategy, data science, or technology innovation, students will graduate equipped to make a lasting impact across industries by harnessing the power of data to solve complex, real-world challenges.
