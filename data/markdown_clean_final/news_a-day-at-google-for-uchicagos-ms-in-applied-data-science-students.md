# A day at Google for UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science students

MS in Applied Data Science Students spend the day at Google

Thirty students from the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) embarked on an exciting adventure on May 20th: a visit to the Google office. This trip was a reward for their completion of the Career Course, a class designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge to navigate the job market.

The day started with a fun icebreaker – students introduced themselves and shared their favorite Google product. The range was impressive, from everyday tools such as Google Calendar to cutting-edge data science solutions like the recently launched large language model Gemini. Next, students got an insider’s perspective through presentations from seven Googlers, each detailing their typical workday experiences.

The highlight for many students was access to [Google Labs](https://labs.google), a digital playground for experimenting with the latest AI tools and testing hypotheses. Students explored projects such as Generative AI with Vertex AI and Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Vertex AI Gemini API.

To wrap up the visit, students toured the Google office, complete with well-stocked snack rooms, an arcade for work breaks, and a unique workspace – an old CTA train car on the rooftop, equipped with Wi-Fi!

#### **Student perspective**

The trip left a lasting impression on the students. Jean-Sebastien Gaultier, a current student in the program, said: “The invitation to Google was a great surprise! Meeting professionals in different sectors of Google Cloud gave me a great idea of the inner workings of Google. The amazing office spaces further enhanced the experience. Working in a 10-story building dedicated to collaboration is inspiring – who wouldn’t want to work at Google after seeing the office?”

Another student, Pamela Gonzalez Muniz, found the Google AM/ML Solutions presentation particularly captivating. “Learning that so many of today’s leading AI technologies originated at Google was fascinating.” She went on to say that gaining insights into future trends and tools was invaluable. What surprised Gonzalez Muniz the most was the well-rounded nature of Google’s employee roles. She noted that all of the presenters possessed strong technical skills, business acumen, and excellent interpersonal abilities.

#### **A day to remember**

The trip to Google offered UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science students a unique opportunity to connect with industry leaders, explore cutting-edge technology, and experience the vibrant Google culture. This unforgettable experience is sure to inspire and motivate the students as they launch their data science careers.
