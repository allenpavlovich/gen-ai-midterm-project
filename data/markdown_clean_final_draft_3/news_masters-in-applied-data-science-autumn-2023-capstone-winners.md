# Master‚Äôs in Applied Data Science Autumn 2023 Capstone Winners

MS in Applied Data Science students use advanced analytics skills to address urgent industry needs.

The [Master of Science in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program culminates in the [Capstone Project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/), where students collaborate with industry partners to solve real-world analytics challenges. At the Autumn Showcase‚Äîone of the program‚Äôs largest‚Äîprojects covered diverse industries, data types, and methodologies. Seven teams received special recognition.

‚ÄúThe hard work, perseverance, and talent is clear from the truly impressive quality of the work,‚Äù said [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/), executive director for the program. ‚ÄúI was especially pleased to see how inventive the teams were in the solutions they developed for their industry partners.‚Äù

Learn more about the Best in Show projects below.

### Brief AI | Revolution in Finance

Presenters: Jose Gerala Palacios, Vishal Parameswaran, Sanchit Narayan Kumar, Garima Sohi

Faculty Advisor: [Nick Kadochnikov](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/nick-kadochnikov/)

Project Topic: Enhanced efficiency for financial analysts using AI tools to analyze earnings calls. The tools included a fine-tuned LLM trained on earnings calls to extract Key Performance Indicators and JAVI, a chatbot enabling conversation based on any earnings call.

### Argonne National Labs | Smart Electric Vehicle Charging: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective

Presenters: Tim Fan, Suenkei Chan, Salman Yousaf, Keerthana Adavelli

Faculty Advisor: [Gizem Aydin](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/gizem-aydim-phd/)

Project Topic: Optimized EV smart charging to reduce grid strain using a simulated environment and dataset based on Argonne‚Äôs EV charging infrastructure. ‚ÄúThe goal was to train and tune a reinforcement learning framework and then evaluate it in terms of energy efficiency, peak power constraints, and user satisfaction,‚Äù the team said.

### New Avenues | Increasing Efficacy of Traditional Employer-Sponsored Mental & Behavioral Support

Presenters: Jinghong (David) He, Luxin (Lucy) Huang, Xueyao Wang, Zhen Jia (Sunny) Sun

Faculty Advisor: [Wendy Klusendorf](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/wendy-klusendorf-ms/)

Project Topic: Developed a procedure for New Avenues to accurately match employees and their dependents in the Employee Assistance Program to appropriate mental healthcare providers. The team used data-driven machine learning to improve matching practices by identifying key patient symptoms that indicate a need for higher levels of care.

### Komatsu | Performance Evaluation of Komatsu Distributors with Telematics Data and Commodity Sales History

Presenters: Minh Vo, Maggie Chuang, Kelsey Liu, Sakshi Shende

Faculty Advisor: [Roger Moore](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/roger-moore-mba/)

Project Topic: Komatsu, a global manufacturer of construction, mining, and forestry equipment, partnered with the capstone team to use machine learning models for analyzing data and improving distributor performance evaluation. The team leveraged commodity sales and telematics machine data to identify relationships between machine data and parts consumption.

### Research (Healthcare GPT) | AI Powered Radiology Report Automation

Presenters: Mariam Adeyemo, Saloni Khandelwal, Preetika Parashar, Yun Xing, Jeniffer Dongha Lee

Faculty Advisor: [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/)

Project Topic: Used AI to generate radiology reports from findings and patient information with a large language model (LLM) trained on MRI and ultrasound data from UChicago Medicine. ‚ÄúThis will greatly assist radiologists by advancing the automation of the documentation process,‚Äù the team said.

### Research (Healthcare GPT) | Decoder-Only Computed Tomography Radiology Reports (DOCTRR)

Presenters: Tegan Keigher, Mary Erikson, Andrew Alvarez

Project Topic: Leveraged large language models to automatically generate accurate findings sections of CT radiology reports, a task that typically requires significant time and effort from radiologists. ‚ÄúOur vector-to-sequence model was in the end capable of producing radiology reports with a level of accuracy and quality comparable to that of human physicians,‚Äù the team said.

### US Ignite | US Ignite National Broadband Tool

Presenters: Kishor Kumar Reddy, Shweta Sampath Kumar, Swathi Ganesan, Marc Edwards

Faculty Advisor: [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/)

Project Topic: Developed an AI tool to predict the economic impact of broadband access and create data- and insight-driven grant proposals to secure government funding. The capstone sponsor collaborates with communities, businesses, local governments, and federal agencies to help community leaders obtain funding and manage broadband transformation projects. Existing studies show that nearly one-third of U.S. cities lack fast, reliable internet, and closing this gap would improve economic opportunities and quality of life in those areas.
