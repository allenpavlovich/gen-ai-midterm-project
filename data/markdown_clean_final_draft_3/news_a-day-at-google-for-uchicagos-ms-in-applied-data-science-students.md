# A day at Google for UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science students

MS in Applied Data Science Students spend the day at Google

Thirty students from the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) visited the Google office on May 20th. This trip rewarded their completion of the Career Course, a class designed to prepare students for the job market.

The day began with a fun icebreaker—students introduced themselves and shared their favorite Google product. The range was impressive, from everyday tools like Google Calendar to advanced data science solutions such as the recently launched large language model Gemini. Students then gained an insider’s perspective through presentations from seven Googlers, each describing their typical workday.

A highlight for many was access to [Google Labs](https://labs.google), a digital playground for experimenting with the latest AI tools and testing hypotheses. Students explored projects like Generative AI with Vertex AI and Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Vertex AI Gemini API.

To conclude the visit, students toured the Google office, featuring well-stocked snack rooms, an arcade for work breaks, and a unique workspace—an old CTA train car on the rooftop, equipped with Wi-Fi.

#### **Student perspective**

The trip left a lasting impression on the students. Jean-Sebastien Gaultier, a current student in the program, said: “The invitation to Google was a great surprise! Meeting professionals in different sectors of Google Cloud gave me a great idea of the inner workings of Google. The amazing office spaces further enhanced the experience. Working in a 10-story building dedicated to collaboration is inspiring – who wouldn’t want to work at Google after seeing the office?”

Another student, Pamela Gonzalez Muniz, found the Google AM/ML Solutions presentation especially captivating. “Learning that so many of today’s leading AI technologies originated at Google was fascinating.” She added that gaining insights into future trends and tools was invaluable. What surprised Gonzalez Muniz most was the well-rounded nature of Google’s employee roles. She noted that all the presenters possessed strong technical skills, business acumen, and excellent interpersonal abilities.

#### **A day to remember**

The trip to Google gave UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science students a unique opportunity to connect with industry leaders, explore cutting-edge technology, and experience Google’s vibrant culture. This memorable experience is sure to inspire and motivate the students as they begin their data science careers.
