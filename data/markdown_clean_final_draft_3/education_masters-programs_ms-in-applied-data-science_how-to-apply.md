## Application Components

### Letters of Recommendation

Two letters of recommendation are required. We *strongly recommend* that at least one letter comes from a direct manager, supervisor, or internship supervisor who can speak to skills you demonstrated or gained in a professional workplace (e.g., leadership, teamwork, collaboration, initiative, management, or similar).

Note: Letters of recommendation can be uploaded after you submit your application. Recommended sources include professors, supervisors or managers, and professional mentors.

Letters from family members, friends, or peers are not accepted.

### Candidate Statement

The candidate statement is a key part of your application. The admissions committee pays close attention to how you present your goals and qualifications. The application will include a prompt with detailed instructions on what to include in your statement.

Best practices:
* Do not restate your resume.
* Your statement should not exceed 1,000 words.

### Resume/CV

The admissions committee will review your resume. Please ensure your resume is carefully updated before submitting.

Include:
* Work experience, including internships and part-time positions in analytics/data science
* Major accomplishments and awards
* Educational background, including areas of study
* Professional conferences attended

Not needed:
* Undergraduate or graduate GPA

### Programming Supplement

Your [application](https://apply-psd.uchicago.edu/apply/) includes a section on programming skills. While applicants with limited R or Python experience can be admitted, the admissions committee values prior programming experience. Include a PDF of *no more than two pages* demonstrating your current programming language skills.

Examples include a PDF of work completed in R or Python. The supplement must be submitted as a PDF. We look for the following in your code (your code does not need to include all of these):
* Ingest data from csv
* Manage different data types
* Use your function for data analysis
* Visualize data
* Wrangle data
* Write your own function
* Import libraries

### Virtual Portfolio

Short, recorded videos responding to prompts within the application are required. These videos provide an alternative way to explain why you are a strong fit for the program.

One video prompt response is required; the other is optional. Each video should be approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds long.

### International Students

* The in-person, full-time program only admits students for the Autumn start.
* Only the full-time, in-person program is visa-eligible.
* International students may also apply to the Online program, which does not require citizenship or permanent resident status and does not provide visa sponsorship.

### English Language Requirement

Applicants who do not meet the English Language Proficiency criteria must submit proof of English proficiency.

Minimum scores: TOEFL, 102 (no subscore requirement); IELTS, 7 (no subscore requirement).

Please review our [waiver policy here](https://grad.uchicago.edu/admissions/apply/english-language-requirements/).

### Transcripts from all previous colleges and universities attended

When applying, only *unofficial* transcripts are required. If admitted, official transcripts must be sent to the following (a bachelor’s degree is required to apply):

Have your institution send e-transcripts directly to:  
**applieddatascience-admissions@uchicago.edu**.

***If*** your institution cannot send documents electronically, have them mail transcripts to the address below.

If documents are mailed, they must arrive in their original, school-sealed envelope. Documents not received in a school-sealed envelope will be considered unofficial. If your transcript does not list degree conferral information (degree earned and date of conferral), an attested copy of your degree certificate is also required.
