# Jan Mrozowski’s Path from Industry Professional to Teaching in the MS in Applied Data Science Program

For Jan Mrozowski (MSADS ‘19), the path to UChicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program was unexpected and initially unplanned. Originally from Eastern Europe and having lived in several countries, Mrozowski returned from Australia in late 2013 to start the next phase of his career in the United States. His first job offer with GE presented a unique opportunity. “I got three job offers, and all of them paid similar amounts of money, but GE told me that they pay 100% tuition at the school of my choice. So I was like, okay, and I joined GE and the University of Chicago at the same time,” he recalls, describing his entry into the newly launched program.

#### **Academic Beginnings and Real-World Experience**

With over a decade of experience in marketing analytics, Mrozowski was already familiar with data science when he entered the program. He established the Data Science function at Woolworths, Australia’s largest retailer, before the term “Data Science” was widely used, serving as Business Support Manager. Later, at GE, he led marketing analytics for the Sam’s Club credit card portfolio, further expanding his hands-on expertise. Although well-versed in analytics, the program helped him refine skills in areas such as data engineering and cloud computing. “That helped me a lot in my career since I joined the program,” he says. “It definitely improved some of my skills, especially in the area of data engineering and cloud computing.”

#### **The Accidental Teacher: From Student to Professor**

Mrozowski’s move into teaching was as unplanned as his entry into the program. While working with fellow students on an assignment, a group member—who also taught at another university—recognized his expertise and encouraged him to consider teaching. This led to his first teaching role at Benedictine University in Naperville while he was still a student. His passion for teaching grew from there. “When I was talking to professors at UChicago, they were like, ‘Why don’t you TA?’ So I thought, why not?” he shares.

This early teaching experience inspired him to pursue a PhD in economics in Poland, sponsored by the National Bank of his home country. Upon returning to Chicago, Mrozowski enrolled in a consulting class taught by [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/) and [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/), who were part of the new program leadership. He valued the insights and perspectives they brought, noting how the curriculum continued to evolve. Since then, Mrozowski has served as a TA for multiple UChicago [Applied Data Science courses](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/), including *Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics*, *Big Data and Cloud Computing*, and *Time Series Analysis and Forecasting*, among others. Reflecting on his experiences, he muses, “If I didn’t go to Europe, maybe I would be teaching by now as well.”

#### **A Love for Data Engineering**

Of the courses Mrozowski has TA’d, [Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/) stands out as his favorite. “I think data engineering is grossly underappreciated,” he explains. “Everybody’s focusing on model development, but it takes a lot of effort to prepare the data.” He shares an example from his current role as head of the risk department at Flex Shopper, where a recent intern was surprised by the complexity and time required for data preparation. “One piece of feedback she had was that she never understood how much time it takes to prepare the data for modeling.”

Mrozowski emphasizes that data engineering requires a deep understanding of data structures and access methods, which are essential for extracting and preparing data in the correct format. He sees it as a crucial foundation for success in the field. Whenever possible, he hires interns and employees from the program, recognizing their strong foundational skills and readiness for real-world challenges.

#### **Supporting Students Through Technical Challenges**

For Mrozowski, one of the most rewarding aspects of being a TA is helping students overcome technical challenges. “Being able to help students when they say, ‘Yes, it finally works,’” he says. Whether troubleshooting code or guiding students through difficult concepts, he takes pride in enabling their success. “You wouldn’t believe how much time I sometimes spend with data engineering students when there is a little-known issue,” he says. From ensuring compatibility with Apple’s latest processors to resolving cloud computing problems, his support often goes beyond the curriculum.

#### **Advice for New Students: Focus on Foundations and Networking**

When asked what advice he would give incoming students, Mrozowski stresses the importance of foundational courses. “Definitely pay more attention to data engineering and big data classes, because they will set you apart and prepare for success,” he advises. He also highlights networking, encouraging students to attend alumni events and build connections within the program’s professional network.

#### **Looking Ahead**

Mrozowski’s unconventional path through the MS in Applied Data Science program has led him to fulfilling roles as a TA, mentor, and leader in his field. His journey—spanning multiple countries and professional milestones—demonstrates the value of embracing unexpected opportunities. Mrozowski remains committed to supporting and inspiring students, reflecting his dedication to advancing the next generation of data science professionals.
