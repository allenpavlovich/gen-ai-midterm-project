Full- and part-time options are available in both the [Online](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/) and [In-Person](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/) formats. Full-time students take 3 classes per quarter (300 units), while part-time students take 2 classes per quarter (200 units).

A sample schedule for the MBA/MS is available on the [Booth website](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/joint-degree/mba-ms-applied-data-science).

*Please note: Course offerings are subject to change. The Pass/Fail Career Seminar is a degree requirement for all students unless eligible for a waiver. There are no tuition or fees for the Career Seminar. Similarly, the optional foundational noncredit courses are available at no additional cost.*

### *Sample Full-Time Schedule*

#### **Prequarter** • 5 Weeks

Optional

* Introduction to Statistical Concepts (Foundational) Optional  
  Held in the 5 weeks before your first quarter, this course provides exposure to basic statistical concepts necessary for understanding advanced program content. 0 units, no cost.

* R for Data Science (Foundational) Optional  
  Also held in the 5 weeks before your first quarter, this course introduces essential concepts and techniques for the statistical computing language R. 0 units, no cost.

#### **Quarter 1** • 10 Weeks

* Python for Data Science (Foundational) Optional  
  Offered during the first five weeks of your first quarter, this course introduces the basic syntax and environment of the Python programming language. 0 units, no cost.

* Advanced Linear Algebra for Machine Learning (Foundational) Optional  
  If required, this course runs during the second five weeks of your first quarter. It focuses on theoretical concepts and real-life applications of linear algebra for machine learning. 0 units, no cost.

Core

* Statistical Models for Data Science Letter Grade  
  In traditional linear models, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response is a linear combination of predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) developed this framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been standard in statistics and data science for nearly two centuries. New methods based on other probability distributions emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century, enabling analysis of variables across broader domains and distributions. Additionally, new methods for analyzing general associations beyond Pearson correlation were developed.

* Leadership and Consulting for Data Science Letter Grade  
  Organizations value data science when it advances their strategic goals, and the job market rewards data scientists who can use data to support organizational interests, either as external consultants or within internal teams. To become successful and marketable leaders, data scientists need strategic awareness to align data and business requirements, technical proficiency to select appropriate methodologies, and communication skills to execute plans as part of a team and persuade others of their findings.

Core (Choose 1)

* Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing Letter Grade  
  Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage. Big Data and Cloud Computing covers approaches to big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data, and multiple emerging software packages exist; the course covers the most popular approaches.

Seminar

* Career Seminar (Required) Pass/Fail  
  The Career Seminar (Pass/Fail) supports the development of professional skills, job and internship searches, and other competencies in demand by employers. Students enroll in the Career Seminar each quarter to engage with unique content throughout their degree program. Students with significant full-time work experience may be eligible to waive this course. 0 units, no cost.

#### **Quarter 2** • 10 Weeks

* Machine Learning I Letter Grade  
  This course introduces machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It provides a rigorous foundation in analytical and software tools for data science projects. Students learn exploratory analyses to detect patterns in multivariate data, hypothesize and detect relationships among variables, conduct confirmatory analyses, and build models for predictive and descriptive purposes. Predictive modeling is presented in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracy.

* Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Letter Grade  
  Time Series Analysis involves making rational predictions based on previous records and is widely used in various business fields.

Elective

* Elective 1 Letter Grade  
  Elective offerings vary. Students work with their academic advisor to select electives based on interests and course availability. A list of sample electives ([subject to change) appear at the bottom of the In-Person](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/) and [Online Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/) pages.

#### **Quarter 3** • 10 Weeks

* Machine Learning II Letter Grade  
  This course has three objectives: first, to extend understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning I into Deep Learning and Generative AI; second, to develop the ability to apply these concepts to diverse practical applications, evaluate results, and recommend next steps; third, to discuss and understand current machine learning and deep learning research and their applications.

* Elective 2 Letter Grade  
  Elective offerings vary. Students work with their academic advisor to select electives based on interests and course availability. A list of sample electives (subject to change) appears at the bottom of the [In-Person](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/in-person-program/) and [Online Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/) pages.

Capstone

* Data Science Capstone Project Letter Grade  
  The required Capstone Project spans two quarters and covers research design, implementation, and writing. Full-time students start the capstone project in their third quarter. Part-time students generally begin in their fifth quarter.

#### **Quarter 4** • 10 Weeks

* Elective 3 Letter Grade

* Elective 4 Letter Grade  
  The Career Seminar (Pass/Fail) supports the development of professional skills, job and internship searches, and other competencies in demand by employers. Students enroll in the Career Seminar each quarter to engage with unique content throughout their degree program. Students with significant full-time work experience may be eligible to waive this course. 0 units, no cost.
