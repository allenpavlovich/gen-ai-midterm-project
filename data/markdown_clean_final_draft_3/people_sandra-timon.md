It's hard to choose! Data Mining was the class that made me feel like I was truly on my way to becoming a data scientist.

#### What advice would you give to prospective students who are seeking a master’s degree in data science?

Know why you want to pursue data science. If you have a current field, consider the current state of analytics and what data science could add to it.

#### What do you enjoy doing outside of work?

I’m taking pottery classes and enjoy how challenging (completely impossible) it is. It’s the exact opposite of my workday and requires full concentration, making it a great break.

#### What excites you right now about the field of data science?

Many people might mention ChatGPT and other LLMs, but I’m more excited about efforts to bring more underrepresented students into the field, like the UChicago Data Science Institute’s Summer Lab, which offers a social environment, mentoring, and opportunities to learn about data science.

#### What is one piece of advice would you give to prospective students?

Panic early (that is, when you get the assignment) rather than waiting to panic until the day before it’s due.
