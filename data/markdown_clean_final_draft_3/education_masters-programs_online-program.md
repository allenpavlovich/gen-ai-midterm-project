* Core Courses

  * Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

    Time Series Analysis involves making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various business fields.

  * Statistical Models for Data Science

    In traditional linear models, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response is a linear combination of predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) developed this framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has dominated statistics/data science for nearly two centuries. New methods based on non-Gaussian probability distributions emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century, enabling analysis of a broader range of variables and distributions. Additionally, new methods for analyzing general associations beyond Pearson correlation were developed.

  * Machine Learning I

    This course introduces students to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It provides a rigorous foundation in analytical and software tools for data science projects. Students learn exploratory analyses to detect patterns in multivariate data, hypothesize and detect relationships among variables, conduct confirmatory analyses, and build models for predictive and descriptive purposes. The course presents predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracy.

  * Machine Learning II

    This course has three objectives: first, to extend understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning I into Deep Learning and Generative AI; second, to apply these concepts to diverse practical applications, evaluate results, and recommend next steps; third, to discuss and understand current machine learning and deep learning research and applications.

  * Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing
