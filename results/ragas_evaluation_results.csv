It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.\n\n  * Statistical Models for Data Science (Core Course)\n\n    In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries. New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.\n\n  * Machine Learning I (Core Course)\n\n    This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation.

Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.\n\n  * Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications (Elective Course)\n\n    This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications.

We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning.

It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.\n\n  * Supply Chain Optimization (Elective Course)\n\n    “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations.
