# 11th Hour Project Software and Data Hub

A centralized hub supporting software and data science for grantees of the 11th Hour Project, which serves nonprofits in energy, food and agriculture, human rights, and marine technology.

The DSI serves as a centralized hub for software and data science for 11th Hour Project grantees. The [11th Hour Project](https://11thhourproject.org/), part of [The Schmidt Family Foundation](https://tsffoundation.org/), serves nonprofits in four main impact areas: energy, food and agriculture, human rights, and marine technology. DSI research staff work to lower the barriers to mission-driven data science through education, consultation, project-based applications and collaboration. UChicago students have the opportunity to drive social and environmental impact through projects with 11th Hour grantees through the [Data Science Clinic](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/data-science-clinic/), [DSI Summer Lab](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/), and ongoing research collaborations.

UChicago Applied Data Science students built data models and evaluated them across different frameworks. They determined that the resulting model is capable of rank-ordering readmission risk, allowing for flexibility and giving air to apply interventions to prevent readmission.

### An NFL Ticket Pricing Study: Optimizing Revenue Using Variable And Dynamic Pricing Methods

UChicago Applied Data Science students strategized a play for an NFL team to implement ticket pricing that responds to changing factors, allowing the team the chance to fill more seats.

### Using Image Recognition to Identify Yoga Poses

UChicago Applied Data Science students stretched themselves to build an app that uses a one-step neural network to examine images of yoga poses and recognize the poses in order to provide feedback to the app’s yoga-practicing user.

### Using Image Recognition to Measure the Speed of a Pitch

One UChicago Applied Data Science Capstone team developed an app that applied image recognition algorithms to measure the speed of a pitched baseball. Their ace app captured video, isolated the pitched ball, calculated the velocity of the pitch, and displayed this measurement so that users would be able to measure the speed of a pitch with their smartphones.

### Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection

Credit card fraud puts consumers’ identities at risk while credit card providers are forced to cover fraudulent charges. A team of Applied Data Science students carefully studied this problem – they created synthetic data that represented a large population of credit card users and built a model that catches credit card fraud in real time.

HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE Study

# Bootstrap: Data Science

## At-A-Glance

Format

Bootstrap is a set of 29 online web-based lessons with optional projects. Student worksheets can be printed on site or purchased as a bound workbook.

Programming Language

Bootstrap uses a programming language called Pyret with lessons also available in  CODAP.

Standards Alignment

Bootstrap provides alignment information for the Common Core State Standards for mathematics and English language arts, the Computer Science Teacher Association Standards, various mathematics textbooks and individual state standards.

Assessment

Bootstrap provides assessment rubrics for every project.

Prerequisites

Bootstrap has no identified prerequisites.

Cost

Bootstrap materials and its cloud-based software are free.

Professional Development

Bootstrap offers a variety of PD models to best meet the needs of their partners and teachers. Accordingly, the cost varies. One model, for example, calls for  5 days in the summer and 4 academic-year sessions. Another is 3 days in the summer with 2 days before the beginning of the academic year. All include coaching sessions. Costs start at $1800 per teacher.

## Key Features

* Flexible structure
* Emphasizes civic responsibility
* Printable student workbook

## Instructional Practices:

Bootstrap’s lessons emphasize coding as well as the data science cycle and  data storytelling. Its design calls for students’ to work alone, in pairs or groups, and as a whole class. They are expected to actively engage in the lessons as they participate in collaborative problem-solving,  critical thinking, and  communication. Bootstrap uses a “notice and wonder” strategy throughout the lessons, asking students to observe data and then ask questions.

Accordingly, the lessons call on teachers to facilitate group work and discussion and to support students’ engagement in critical thinking. Teachers are also expected to support students’ reflection, curiosity and skepticism as they work. With Bootstrap’s periodic teacher guidance, teachers have a lot of flexibility to make their own decisions about how best to implement these pedagogical strategies.

## Lesson Structure:

Bootstrap lessons have both student-facing and teacher-facing content with pdf worksheets for each lesson that can be printed separately or purchased as a workbook. (Users who want to do their own workbook printing can obtain the entire workbook pdf for free.) Additionally, for some lessons Bootstrap has linked Desmos activities for teachers to use if they wish. While the lessons are teacher-facing, most of the lesson content is intended to be student-facing. The student-facing content is available on slides for teachers who want to use them.

The lessons begin with a teacher-facing text block that includes some or all of the following sections: lesson goals, prerequisite lessons (within Bootstrap), materials needed (with links to slides, pdf student handouts, and starter files) supplemental materials, student preparation and key instructional points for the teacher. They also include a glossary for terms specific to the lesson. Each lesson has 2-5 sections labeled with their intended duration. Within each part, the lesson activities are labeled with one of the following headings: overview, launch, investigate, synthesize. The online lessons also include “Teacher Tips,” examples of student answers, and common student misconceptions. They also have periodic messages to teachers focused on a range of topics from additional instructional activities to practical matters such as IT.

## Design Features:

One of the most notable features of Bootstrap’s design, compared to others, is its intentional adaptability and flexibility. Bootstrap was designed to be used with a wide range of student age groups from 7th -12th grade and can range from a semester to a year. To accommodate this range, Bootstrap has flexibility in the number of lessons a teacher uses as well as the depth to which students engage with data science concepts through optional activities. Teachers also have space to adapt lessons to their students’ needs and to supplement the curriculum for further enrichment.

Of all of the curricula, Bootstrap has lessons that are most explicit about inclusion and diversity as well as  data responsibility  . The first lesson in fact, uses images of data scientists from groups underrepresented in STEM. They also take the position that data science education should include: domain of study, computing, statistics and mathematics and civic responsibility. Further, the fifth unit is focused on “using data responsibly.” Bootstrap also emphasizes the  data science cycle  and data storytelling. Like the other curricula, Bootstrap includes projects as well as authentic data sets examples designed to be relevant for the students.

Finally, Bootstrap teaches students using a coding language called Pyret. Pyret development was informed by research and has been specifically designed for classroom contexts. Lessons that use CODAP are also available.

## Teacher Support Materials and Resources:

Bootstrap provides a range of data sets for teachers and students to choose from. Other support materials include help videos, a bilingual glossary of terms, a range of classroom visuals, homework submission templates and templates for other student activities. The Bootstrap leaders facilitate an online community for asking questions and communicating with other Bootstrap teachers.

# CourseKata: Statistics and Data Science

## At-A-Glance

Format

CourseKata is composed of an online interactive book and a web-based “Teaching Dashboard” that includes Jupyter Notebooks  designed to be integrated into the course.

Programming Language

CourseKata uses R with Jupyter Notebooks .

Standards Alignment

CourseKata provides alignment information for the Common Core State Standards for mathematics It also has a customized alignment document for the state of Utah (created to assist Utah with its pilot).

Assessment

There is a Learning Management System (Canvas, Blackboard, or Moodle) that enables the teacher to monitor progress. CourseKata provides quizzes and tests in addition to assessment rubrics for every projects.

Prerequisites

Course Kata’s AB book (the one reviewed here) has no required prerequisites. The ABC book recommends Algebra II as a prerequisite.

Cost

CourseKata costs $24/student each year with discounts available for multi-year contracts.

Professional Development

CourseKata offers study groups that include either seven one-hour sessions three times a week for two weeks in the summer or one time a week for seven weeks during the academic year. It also offers targeted workshops (e.g. pacing, grading). PD is $800/teacher for each of the first two years of use, which includes permanent access to study groups, office hours and other supports.

## Key Features:

* Emphasizes statistics
* Interactive online book with Jupyter notebooks
* Learning management system

## Instructional Practices:

CourseKata instruction entails interactive textbook instruction with associated problem solving in Jupyter notebooks. Teachers are free to use these features differently, with some assigning the textbook for homework and then emphasizing the Jupyter notebook work in class while others balance engaging students in textbook content during class time with the Jupyter notebook activities. The book guides the student through content acquisition using embedded interactive exercises while the Jupyter notebooks have teacher-facing content with summaries, highlighted skills and concepts, estimated completion times and other teaching suggestions.

Throughout instruction, students are expected to  think critically while engaging in investigations and the data science process. There is a particular emphasis on students embracing trial and error and understanding that persisting in the face of failure is part of successful problem solving. CourseKata is designed so that teachers make decisions about organizational structure (i.e. whole class, groups, pairs) and when to introduce opportunities for peer communication.

## Lesson Structure:

The CourseKata book is organized into three “Parts” with Parts I + II (AB) comprising an introductory year-long course. There are 9 chapters in total with each chapter having between 9-14 sections. Each section is roughly aligned with a different topic. The basic format of the book is text with embedded interactive student exercises throughout. The Jupyter notebooks have two versions, one that is student facing and another that is teacher-facing. The teacher-facing version includes a summary, a list of included concepts and skills, approximate times for completion for each section, sample responses, and links to complementary resources. The format of the notebook lessons varies but generally includes an examination of a data set and using it to explore variation, and creating visualizations and models to answer questions.

## Design Features:

CourseKata is unique among the curricula in that its learning management system (LMS) format enables teachers to regularly monitor students’ progress on both daily exercises and in-chapter exercises, tests and quizzes. Additionally, the book has a teacher view that includes answers to exercises. The LMS format supports other features such as teacher-created syllabi.

Another distinguishing feature is that CourseKata is a book and as such, requires that students do a significant amount of reading and depending on how it is used, a lot of independent work. The books leave space for teachers to make decisions about how they want to present the book content while the Jupyter notebooks provide teachers with more guidance for facilitating students’ learning.

## Teacher Support and Resource Materials:

In addition to the monitoring and assessment tools that reside in the LMS, CourseKata’s Teaching Dashboard includes a searchable section with instructor-submitted materials including syllabi, Jupyter notebooks and teaching recommendations. CourseKata also provides teachers with help videos and weekly course outlines. Additionally, CourseKata has a “discourse community” teachers can enter to exchange ideas as well as weekly office hours available to instructors for guidance on teaching the course.

Finally, CourseKata has been designed to provide opportunities for teachers to give feedback on the book itself. They are in a regular process of materials improvement and collect student data and teacher input to inform their revision process.

The first year is focused on implementation and costs $5,500 per participant. The second year focuses on deeper data analysis and costs $2,818 per participant. PD is complimentary for 2 administrators or counselors.

## Key Features:

* Inquiry-based philosophy
* Student data collection campaigns
* Detailed teacher guidance

## Instructional Practices:

IDS is explicit about its inquiry-based philosophy and embraces the [BSCS](https://bscs.org/) 5-E model (engage, explore, explain, elaborate and evaluate) across its lessons. Its student-centered approach is clear in that it has data “campaigns” during which students develop data sets themselves using a participatory data collection process. Students use these data sets as well as existing large data sets throughout the curriculum. The lessons focus on finding meaning in data and they use a range of media to engage students including articles in magazines or news outlets, hands-on manipulatives such as dice or marbles, and other materials such as index cards and poster boards.

Many lessons explicitly build on the lessons immediately prior as they cluster around conceptual themes such as visualization and experiments as well as overarching topics such as garbage and water. Students are expected to do projects, engage with data science creatively and to think about and tell data stories. Additionally, the lessons give very specific teacher guidance for facilitating  critical thinking, collaboration, and communication with student group work being the predominant classroom organizational structure. Students have opportunities to self-assess and other assessments are rubric based.

## Lesson Structure:

IDS has four units with theme-based sections in those units and then lessons within each section. Each section has an overview of the “enduring understandings” for the theme, approaches for engaging students, section learning objectives, language objectives and the data file or data collection used. Then, each daily lesson within the section begins with the lesson objective, the materials needed for the lesson, the “essential concepts” and the vocabulary.

Each lesson has detailed step-by-step teacher guidance with periodic teacher notes focused on topics to review. Lessons also provide teachers with specific stage-setting introductions, questions and prompts to support students in the learning process. Lessons use a combination of whole class, team and paired work with much of the lesson time spent with students working in teams. Students are expected to play particular roles in their teams and at the end of each class, one team of students reports out on the most important topics of the day. Students are also expected to engage in regular communication and critical thinking as they move through inquiry-based lessons.

## Design Features:

Overall IDS is organized to highlight features of data science and then addresses programming and statistics through that lens. The curriculum is available as both, an online curriculum available to teachers who complete the IDS professional development and a downloadable pdf available to anybody. In addition to downloadable student worksheet pdfs for each lesson, IDS also includes lab response sheets and data collection organizers as downloadable pdfs. Some lessons are unplugged. The lessons are sequenced so that they focus on learning data science and statistics concepts which lead to labs where they engage in data analysis and visualization. The lessons use R through RStudio to answer questions and document answers in their data journals. All computer based assignments are intended to be completed in class so that no student is limited by their access to technology.

Another distinguishing characteristic of IDS is the use of student-collected data. In addition to large authentic data sets accompanying the lessons, students work with data generated during class time or with data collected as part of data “campaigns.” These campaigns include students engaging in participatory sensing which entails using their mobile devices to gather data as human sensors.

## Teacher Support and Resource Materials:

IDS provides teachers with supports such as lists of goals and objectives, weekly course outlines, and technology requirements and resources. Additionally, IDS has educative materials for teachers. For example, materials include content on the purpose of the study team structure, how to organize and facilitate study teams and the inquiry-based philosophy. There is also detailed guidance on students’ roles on their teams and examples of what to listen for to ensure they are in fact playing these roles as taught. Other teacher resources provide specific strategies for facilitating discussion, reflection, summarizing and sharing out. IDS also includes a weekly schedule to aid in pacing.

IDS provides support for teachers throughout the year. Support includes a “ticketing system” through which teachers can get quick responses to their questions.

HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE Study / The Curriculum

# Youcubed: Explorations in Data Science

## At-A-Glance

Format

Youcubed is a set of 8 online project-based units. Lesson plans, slides and student handouts for the course are provided.

Programming Language

Youcubed uses  CODAP   
 and  EduBlocks   
 as well as technology tools such as Tableau and Google Data Commons, Sheets, and Colab using Python.

Standards Alignment

Youcubed provides alignment information for the Common Core State Standards for mathematics and English language arts as well as the California computer science standards.

Assessment

Youcubed provides criteria for assessing the projects at the end of each unit and explicit opportunities for student self-assessment. Over time, students compile their project work into a portfolio.

Prerequisites

Algebra 1 and Geometry or Math 1 and Math 2.

Cost

Youcubed materials are free.

Professional Development

Youcubed offers professional development in two formats: weekly 2-hour sessions during the academic year or 4 daylong sessions in the summer online or in person. The 4-day session is $1990 per person and $1800 per person for groups of 2 or more. Additionally, youcubed offers office hours and a community message board for support from other teachers implementing the curriculum.

## Key Features:

* Completely project-based with student relevant themes
* Uses CODAP, EduBlocks and Python in Google Colab
* Frequent and explicit opportunities for student reflection

## Instructional Practices:

Youcubed emphasizes data science and statistics concepts while addressing programming as called for within the context of each unit’s project-based theme. The lesson design focuses on authentic, student relevant datasets and has students work alone, in pairs, in groups and as a whole class in teacher guided interactive lessons. Youcubed students engage in  critical thinking, problem solving, and student communication regularly. The curriculum also aims to develop skepticism and reflection, and asks students to explore questions related to data ethics.

Each youcubed unit begins with a “data talk” or reading as a foundation for students sharing what they “notice” and what they “wonder.” Together, the lessons in each unit work through the data science process and end with an expectation that students communicate about their work. During the lessons, teachers are provided with guidance for facilitating class discussions as well as students’ critical thinking and engagement in the data science process. Youcubed also has “intermission” lessons that have students focus on a topic related to the unit task and frequently emphasize data ethics. Additionally, youcubed has prioritized student reflection by providing specific weekly reflection tasks. Lessons also provide links to multimedia resources to complement the content.

## Lesson Structure:

Each of youcubed’s 8 project-based units begins with an overview of the unit topics, the length of the unit, unit resources (such as weekly outlines), student handouts and sample student work. The lessons, designed to be 50 minutes, are teacher-facing but are accompanied by student-facing slides the teacher can use during class.

Each unit has 2-9 sections and then up to 11 headings in each section labeled with words like, “explore,” “discuss,” “share,” “gather data,” “organize data” and “reflection,” indicating the primary focus at that point in the learning experience. The teacher facing content provides directions for guiding students through their learning experience with suggested prompts and questions for class facilitation. There are also periodic Teacher Notes with guidance for teachers to consider. Youcubed also includes “important messages” to the teacher focused on a mathematics mindset and data science topics for teachers to consider.

## Design Features:

The most clear feature that distinguishes youcubed from the other curricula is the fact that all lessons are situated in the context of a larger theme. Accordingly, lessons all connect with the theme and lead to a culminating project. In addition to CODAP and EduBlocks as key non-text-based programming tools, youcubed uses a number of other technology tools such as Tableau and Python using Google Colab. The Youcubed project-based units are self-contained so there is some flexibility regarding the order in which they are taught.

Youcubed also has more frequent and concrete opportunities for student reflection compared to the other curricula. It provides several tools to support this including a student concept organizer for students to document concepts and vocabulary and designated reflection time. Youcubed also provides a rubric for students to reflect on their work with their groups.

#### Teacher Support and Resource Materials:

Youcubed has a number of teacher supports including help videos, links to teacher tutorials, and a community message board available to teachers who have completed the professional development. Additionally, it provides an outline of weekly 50 minute classes that summarizes the lessons and can assist with pacing. Youcubed also provides a full resource of sample student work from students with a variety of backgrounds and experiences.

Additionally, PD participants have access to a community bulletin board where they can communicate with other teachers and the developers. Youcubed also offers free office hours for one hour every other week and teachers can also communicate directly with developers by email.

* [Core Courses](#)

  * [Time Series Analysis and Forecasting](#accordion-tab-0) 

    Time Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.
  * [Statistical Models for Data Science](#accordion-tab-1) 

    In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.
  * [Machine Learning I](#accordion-tab-2) 

    This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies.
  * [Machine Learning II](#accordion-tab-3) 

    The objective of this course is three-folds–first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications.
  * [Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing](#accordion-tab-4) 

    Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market.

    Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data and multiple emerging software packages exist to work with it, and we will cover the most popular approaches.
  * [Leadership and Consulting for Data Science](#accordion-tab-5) 

    The Leadership and Consulting for Data Scientist course is focused on:

    • Learning techniques and proven methods to effectively grasp the business domain including organizational dynamics of consultancies and client organizations  
    • Developing relevant solutions to enterprise problems using the sampling methods, traditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning models that deliver value to the organization  
    • Practicing successful project delivery through effective data discovery, influential team membership and leadership, project management, and communication at every stage

    This course will not only make you a better data scientist; it will make you and your analyses more approachable, more persuasive, and ultimately more successful.
  * [Data Science Capstone Project](#accordion-tab-6) 

    The required Capstone Project is completed over two quarters and covers research design, implementation, and writing. Full-time students start their capstone project in their third quarter. Part-time students generally begin the capstone project in their fifth quarter.
* [Sample Elective Courses](#)

  * [Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning](#accordion-tab-0) 

    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.
  * [Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](#accordion-tab-1) 

    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.
  * [Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications](#accordion-tab-2) 

    This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques.

It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.

  Core

  * [Statistical Models for Data Science Letter Grade](#accordion-tab-0)

    In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.

  Core

  * [Leadership and Consulting for Data Science Letter Grade](#accordion-tab-0)

    Professional organizations see value in data science when it helps them to achieve their strategic goals, and the current job market likewise rewards data scientists who can use data to advance organizational interests, either as an external consultant or within internal operations teams. Data scientists can become successful (and highly marketable) leaders in today’s professional world, but they require an uncommon skill set: the strategic awareness to align data requirements with business requirements, the technical proficiency to choose a methodology appropriate to each new problem, and the communication skills to both execute the plan as part of a broader team and persuade others of their findings.

    Time Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.
  * [Statistical Models for Data Science](#accordion-tab-1) 

    In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.
  * [Machine Learning I](#accordion-tab-2) 

    This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms.

  * [Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning](#accordion-tab-0) 

    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.
  * [Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](#accordion-tab-1) 

    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.
  * [Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications](#accordion-tab-2) 

    This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.
  * [Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing](#accordion-tab-3) 

    This course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI. The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class discussions, group assignments, and a final group project. The course lays special emphasis on algorithms. Hence it draws heavily from the fields of optimization, machine-learning based recommendation systems, association rules, consumer choice models, Bayesian estimation, experimentation and analysis of covariance, advanced visualization techniques for mapping brand perceptions, and analysis of social media data using advanced NLP techniques.
  * [Data Visualization Techniques](#accordion-tab-4) 

    In today’s data driven enterprise, data storytelling using effective visualization strategies is an essential skill for analytics practitioners in almost every field to explore and present data. This course focuses on modern data visualization technologies, tools, and techniques to convert raw data into actionable information. Modern data visualization tools are at the forefront of the “self-service analytics” architectures which are decentralizing analytics and breaking down IT bottlenecks for business experts. Moreover, with its foundations rooted in statistics, psychology, and computer science, data visualization shows you how to better understand the data, present clear evidence of your findings to your intended audience and tell engaging data stories through charts and graphics. This course is designed to introduce data visualization as a medium of effective communication using strategic storytelling, and the basis for interactive information dashboards.
  * [Digital Marketing Analytics in Theory and Practice](#accordion-tab-5) 

    Successfully marketing brands today requires a well-balanced blend of art and science. This course introduces students to the science of web analytics while casting a keen eye toward the artful use of numbers found in the digital space.

The course puts special emphasis on covering main steps of building analytics from visualizing data and building intuition about their structure and patterns to selecting appropriate statistical method to interpretation of the results and building analytical models. Topics are illustrated by data analysis projects using R. Basic familiarity with R is a requirement.
  * [Generative AI Principles](#accordion-tab-8) 

    This course dives into the realm of Generative AI, offering a comprehensive look into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation techniques, and the fusion of vision and text through multimodal models. Drawing from core concepts in neural networks, transformers, and advanced techniques such as prompt engineering, vision prompting, and multimodality representation, students will explore the capabilities, applications, and ethical considerations of generative models. This course culminates in hands-on projects, allowing participants to apply theory to practical scenarios.
  * [Machine Learning Operations](#accordion-tab-9) 

    The objective of this course is two-fold: first, to understand what Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is and why it is a key component in enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects, and second, to expose students to software engineering, model engineering and state-of-the-art deployment engineering with hands-on platform and tools experience. This course crosses the chasm that separates machine learning projects/experiments and enterprise production deployment. It covers three pillars in MLOps: software engineering such as software architecture, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and data versioning; model engineering such as AutoML and A/B experimentation; and deployment engineering such as docker containers and model monitoring. The course focuses on best practices in the industry that are critical to enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects. Having completed this course, a student understands the machine learning lifecycle and what it takes to go from ideation to operationalization in an enterprise environment. Furthermore, students get exposure to state-of-the-art MLOps platforms such as allegro, xpresso, Dataiku, LityxIQ, DataRobot, AWS Sagemaker, and technologies such as gitHub, Jenkins, slack, docker, and kubernetes.
  * [Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing](#accordion-tab-10) 

    Extracting actionable insights from unstructured text and designing cognitive applications have become significant areas of application for analytics. Students in this course will learn foundations of natural language processing, including: concept extraction; text summarization and topic modeling; part of speech tagging; named entity recognition; semantic roles and sentiment analysis. For advanced NLP applications, we will focus on feature extraction from unstructured text, including word and paragraph embedding and representing words and paragraphs as vectors. For cognitive analytics section of the course, students will practice designing question answering systems with intent classification, semantic knowledge extraction and reasoning under uncertainty. Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding.
  * [Real Time Intelligent Systems](#accordion-tab-11) 

    Developing end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students. The course focuses on python and is tailored for students with basic programming knowledge in python. The course is partially project based. During the first three sessions, we will review basic python concepts and then learn more advanced python and the ways to use python to handle large data flows. The later sessions are project based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems.
  * [Reinforcement Learning](#accordion-tab-12) 

    This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.
  * [Supply Chain Optimization](#accordion-tab-13) 

    “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain. Students will also learn how to optimize the performance of the Supply Chain from the lens of multiple related disciplines including: Sales Forecasting, Warehousing/Inventory Management, Promotion, Pricing, Logistics Network Optimization, Freight Cost Management, Manufacturing, Retail POS Information, Ecommerce, Consumer Data, and Product Design/Packaging. After completing this course, you will be prepared to work in any of the numerous specialty areas possible in the world of Supply Chain Management.

  * [Statistical Models for Data Science](#accordion-tab-1) 

    In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.
  * [Machine Learning I](#accordion-tab-2) 

    This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms.

  * [Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning](#accordion-tab-0) 

    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.
  * [Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](#accordion-tab-1) 

    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools.

  * [Statistical Models for Data Science](#accordion-tab-1) 

    In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.

  * [Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning](#accordion-tab-0) 

    Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.
  * [Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](#accordion-tab-1) 

    Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.
  * [Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications](#accordion-tab-2) 

    This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.
  * [Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing](#accordion-tab-3) 

    This course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI. The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class discussions, group assignments, and a final group project. The course lays special emphasis on algorithms. Hence it draws heavily from the fields of optimization, machine-learning based recommendation systems, association rules, consumer choice models, Bayesian estimation, experimentation and analysis of covariance, advanced visualization techniques for mapping brand perceptions, and analysis of social media data using advanced NLP techniques.
  * [Data Science for Healthcare](#accordion-tab-4) 

    Given the breadth of the field of health analytics, this course will provide an overview of the development and rapid expansion of analytics in healthcare, major and emerging topical areas, and current issues related to research methods to improve human health. We will cover such topics as security concerns unique to the field, research design strategies, and the integration of epidemiologic and quality improvement methodologies to operationalize data for continuous improvement. Students will be introduced to the application of predictive analytics to healthcare. Students will understand factors impacting the delivery of quality and safe patient care and the application of data-driven methods to improve care at the healthcare system level, design approaches to answering a research question at the population level, become familiar with the application of data analytics to impacting care at the provider level through Clinical Decision Systems, and understand the process of a Clinical Trial.
  * [Data Visualization Techniques](#accordion-tab-5) 

    In today’s data driven enterprise, data storytelling using effective visualization strategies is an essential skill for analytics practitioners in almost every field to explore and present data. This course focuses on modern data visualization technologies, tools, and techniques to convert raw data into actionable information. Modern data visualization tools are at the forefront of the “self-service analytics” architectures which are decentralizing analytics and breaking down IT bottlenecks for business experts. Moreover, with its foundations rooted in statistics, psychology, and computer science, data visualization shows you how to better understand the data, present clear evidence of your findings to your intended audience and tell engaging data stories through charts and graphics. This course is designed to introduce data visualization as a medium of effective communication using strategic storytelling, and the basis for interactive information dashboards.
  * [Digital Marketing Analytics in Theory and Practice](#accordion-tab-6) 

    Successfully marketing brands today requires a well-balanced blend of art and science. This course introduces students to the science of web analytics while casting a keen eye toward the artful use of numbers found in the digital space. The goal is to provide marketers with the foundation needed to apply data analytics to real-world challenges they confront daily in their professional lives. Students will learn to identify the web analytic tool right for their specific needs; understand valid and reliable ways to collect, analyze, and visualize data from the web; and utilize data in decision making for their agencies, organizations or clients. By completing this course, students will gain an understanding of the motivations behind data collection and analysis methods used by marketing professionals; learn to evaluate and choose appropriate web analytics tools and techniques; understand frameworks and approaches to measuring consumers’ digital actions; earn familiarity with the unique measurement opportunities and challenges presented by New Media; gain hands-on, working knowledge of a step-by-step approach to planning, collecting, analyzing, and reporting data; utilize tools to collect data using today’s most important online techniques: performing bulk downloads, tapping APIs, and scraping webpages; and understand approaches to visualizing data effectively.
  * [Financial Analytics](#accordion-tab-7) 

    This course concentrates on the following topics: review of financial markets and assets traded on them; main characteristics of financial analytics: returns, yields, volatility; review of stochastic models of market price and their statistical representations; concept of arbitrage, elements of arbitrage pricing approach; principles of volatility analyses, implied vs. realized volatility; correlation, cointegration and other relationships between various financial assets; market risk analytics and management of portfolios of financial assets. The course puts special emphasis on covering main steps of building analytics from visualizing data and building intuition about their structure and patterns to selecting appropriate statistical method to interpretation of the results and building analytical models. Topics are illustrated by data analysis projects using R. Basic familiarity with R is a requirement.
  * [Generative AI Principles](#accordion-tab-8) 

    This course dives into the realm of Generative AI, offering a comprehensive look into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation techniques, and the fusion of vision and text through multimodal models. Drawing from core concepts in neural networks, transformers, and advanced techniques such as prompt engineering, vision prompting, and multimodality representation, students will explore the capabilities, applications, and ethical considerations of generative models. This course culminates in hands-on projects, allowing participants to apply theory to practical scenarios.
  * [Machine Learning Operations](#accordion-tab-9) 

    The objective of this course is two-fold: first, to understand what Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is and why it is a key component in enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects, and second, to expose students to software engineering, model engineering and state-of-the-art deployment engineering with hands-on platform and tools experience. This course crosses the chasm that separates machine learning projects/experiments and enterprise production deployment. It covers three pillars in MLOps: software engineering such as software architecture, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and data versioning; model engineering such as AutoML and A/B experimentation; and deployment engineering such as docker containers and model monitoring. The course focuses on best practices in the industry that are critical to enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects. Having completed this course, a student understands the machine learning lifecycle and what it takes to go from ideation to operationalization in an enterprise environment. Furthermore, students get exposure to state-of-the-art MLOps platforms such as allegro, xpresso, Dataiku, LityxIQ, DataRobot, AWS Sagemaker, and technologies such as gitHub, Jenkins, slack, docker, and kubernetes.
  * [Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing](#accordion-tab-10) 

    Extracting actionable insights from unstructured text and designing cognitive applications have become significant areas of application for analytics. Students in this course will learn foundations of natural language processing, including: concept extraction; text summarization and topic modeling; part of speech tagging; named entity recognition; semantic roles and sentiment analysis. For advanced NLP applications, we will focus on feature extraction from unstructured text, including word and paragraph embedding and representing words and paragraphs as vectors. For cognitive analytics section of the course, students will practice designing question answering systems with intent classification, semantic knowledge extraction and reasoning under uncertainty. Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding.
  * [Real Time Intelligent Systems](#accordion-tab-11) 

    Developing end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students. The course focuses on python and is tailored for students with basic programming knowledge in python. The course is partially project based. During the first three sessions, we will review basic python concepts and then learn more advanced python and the ways to use python to handle large data flows. The later sessions are project based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems.
  * [Reinforcement Learning](#accordion-tab-12) 

    This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.
  * [Supply Chain Optimization](#accordion-tab-13) 

    “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain. Students will also learn how to optimize the performance of the Supply Chain from the lens of multiple related disciplines including: Sales Forecasting, Warehousing/Inventory Management, Promotion, Pricing, Logistics Network Optimization, Freight Cost Management, Manufacturing, Retail POS Information, Ecommerce, Consumer Data, and Product Design/Packaging. After completing this course, you will be prepared to work in any of the numerous specialty areas possible in the world of Supply Chain Management.

DSI Summer Lab

# Program Details

The Data Science Institute Summer Lab program (launched in 2018 as the Data & Computing Summer Lab) is an immersive 8-week paid summer research program at the University of Chicago. In the program, undergraduate students (and Chicago-area high school students) are paired with data science mentors in various domains, including computer science, data science, social science, climate and energy policy, public policy, materials science, and biomedical research. Through this pairing the research assistant will engage with and hone their skills in research methodologies, practices, and teamwork. We encourage participation from a broad range of students, and require no prior research experience to apply.

#### SUMMER LAB 2025

Info session: December 12, 2024, 5pm CT ([register here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0pfu-ppzwpEtw2Gnko8CYicvm1bcN425eK))

Application deadline: January 12, 2025, 11:59pm CT

Program dates: June 16th – August 8th, 2025

Stipend: $5600

Housing: UChicago dormitory housing available free of charge for college-aged students. Housing is not available for high school students

#### BENEFITS

Students in the program are immersed in a research lab and given unparalleled, first-hand access to impactful, applied data science research. Students will gain not only an understanding of fundamental data science methodologies but specialized training within the application areas specific to their lab’s research thrust. Students are asked to practice communicating their research findings throughout the summer, culminating in [final videos](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/dsi-summer-lab-students-present-wide-ranging-research/). The final videos are presented during an end-of-summer symposium, which is run like a professional conference and provides students a chance to field questions about their project and share the outcomes of their research projects. Students also engage in professional development and training that can help them prepare for future careers in data science and computing. Additionally, some alumni continue research work with their mentor after the program ends.

#### COHORT

In the program, students are welcomed into a cohort of their peers who represent diverse backgrounds, interests, and ambitions. Through near-peer mentoring, social gatherings, and group work on projects, students in this cohort not only become better trained data and computational scientists, but better equipped to tackle any challenges ahead through their experience with group work and collaboration.

#### MOTIVATION

Creating an inclusive and welcoming cohort for students to become a part of is a critical component of Summer Lab, as well as providing opportunities for students to see themselves represented in program mentors, guest speakers, and leadership. Computational work is often stereotyped as people working alone writing code, when in reality data science is a team sport, inherently interdisciplinary, and in constant conversation with real-world issues to achieve measurable, meaningful impact. We aim to not only train and immerse students in research methodologies, data science skills, and domain expertise, but also to prepare them for critical transitions and sustained career paths.

#### PROGRAMMING

An exciting array of programming is provided students during the summer. A highlight of the summer programming is a weekly speaker series featuring researchers at the forefront of data science. Speakers address topics ranging from their own unique and unconventional paths to data science research, to their innovative approaches to tackling important, impactful research questions. Students have the chance not only to hear from first-class speakers but also to introduce and be in conversation with them. Programming also includes social events like baseball games, trivia, picnics, concerts, mini golf, and more.

#### ALUMNI

Summer Lab alumni have been co-authors on published papers and posters, created apps and software tools used by thousands of people, and pursued a variety of future paths within research and beyond. Check out the [Project Profiles](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/alumni-and-projects/) to learn more about previous student cohorts, and watch videos overviewing their summer research projects. Summer Lab alumna Aarthi Koripelly (‘19, ‘20) shared this about her experience in the program:

“*Summer Lab was a great experience for me to have exposure to the applications of computer science in other domains and gain technical knowledge. My projects have helped me hone my research and communication skills in writing reports, presenting to others, and submitting to a conference, which would not have been possible without the opportunities the program has provided.*”

**Abstract:** Diffusion models demonstrate robust generative capabilities by approximating dataset distributions and synthesizing data through sampling. In this talk I will discuss our recent work investigating how incorporating temporally correlated noise sources—inspired by active matter physics—affects generative performance during the forward destruction process. We derive the necessary cost function for training models with exponentially correlated noise in the diffusion process and evaluate this approach across diverse datasets: multi-scale 2D distributions, high-dimensional Ising model spin configurations at varying temperatures, and molecular microscopic degrees of freedom. Our results indicate that this active noise approach can enhance the reverse diffusion sampling process compared to standard passive models. Through analytical calculations, we propose that this improvement stems from accelerated speciation time during sampling and more efficient resolution of high-frequency data modes. This physically-motivated modification to score-based diffusion models offers a novel optimization strategy that may reduce both training and inference times across application.

**!Bio: Suri Vaikuntanathan** is a Professor in Chemistry at the University of Chicago. He completed his B.Tech in Biotechnology from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2006, followed by a Ph.D. in Chemical Physics from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2011. After completing his postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley in 2014, he established his independent research career. His group develops theoretical and simulation methods to study far-from-equilibrium systems, investigating principles of assembly and pattern formation under non-equilibrium conditions. They also explore the relationship between energy dissipation and information processing in biological circuits, examining how biological systems maintain sensitivity and robustness in noisy environments. His honors include ACS Early Career Award in Theoretical Chemistry (2023), the Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award (2020), an NSF CAREER Award (2018), and an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship (2017).

AI for Climate Speaker Series

**AI for Climate Modeling: Present and Future**

AI-driven weather forecast models are now more accurate and much faster than the best physics-based models. The open-source Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE) uses similar technology to accurately emulate both daily weather variability (including extremes) and climate of historical reanalysis or of a reference global atmospheric model. ACE runs 100x faster than a physics-based model of similar grid resolution – 1600 years per day on a 100 km grid with a single GPU.  ACE can be forced by specified sea-surface temperatures or coupled to a slab ocean model (SOM).  When trained on SOM-coupled reference model simulations spanning multiple climates forced by changed CO2 concentrations, ACE can accurately emulate the reference model climate change response.  We have coupled ACE to an AI-based ocean emulator called Samudra; when trained on a pre-industrial control simulation of a reference physically-based GCM simulation, the resulting emulator reproduces its mean climate and ENSO characteristics. Lastly, we discuss key remaining challenges to general-purpose use of ACE for climate modeling applications.

# 2022 AI + Science Summer School

August 8, 2022 9:00 AM – 12, 2022 5:00 PM

University of Chicago

!

Samantha Riesenfeld, Assistant Professor of Molecular Engineering and Genetic Medicine at the University of Chicago, presents “Mathematical Models for Single-Cell Genomic Data: Challenges and Opportunities” on Day 3.

#### ***The first AI + Science Summer School was a huge success! Join [the DSI newsletter](http://eepurl.com/gfJPtT) for announcements about next year’s program.***

Modern artificial intelligence and machine learning will fundamentally change scientific discovery. We are just beginning to understand the possibilities presented by an era of extraordinarily powerful computers coupled with advanced instruments capable of collecting enormous volumes of high-resolution experimental data. Off-the-shelf machine learning tools cannot fully extract the knowledge contained in these datasets, let alone generate new theories and propose future experiments.

The [AI + Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/) Summer School was an August 2022 event jointly hosted by the Data Science Institute (DSI) and [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/) (IMSI) at the University of Chicago. It focused on four core themes at the heart of this emerging paradigm of scientific discovery: AI uncovering new laws of nature, AI guiding scientific measurement, physics-informed machine learning, and scientific discovery advancing AI frontiers.

Speakers and talks at the summer school included (click link to watch video):

* Christoph Ortner – “[Atomic Cluster Expansion – A Framework For Modeling Equivariant Properties Of Atoms And Molecules](https://youtu.be/b_pCIBmxco8)“
* Camille Avestruz – “[Machine Learning in Astrophysics/Cosmology](https://youtu.be/w27y4DJtUc4)“
* Romit Maulik – “[Learning Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Using Scientific Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/o6fwxR8Z6dQ)“
* Risi Kondor – “[Equivariant Neural Networks For Physics And Chemistry](https://youtu.be/aV53qMATxDM)“
* Panel (Eric Jonas, Romit Maulik, Christoph Ortner, Samanthan Riesenfeld; moderated by David Miller) – “[Moving beyond the ML Hype – Research Frontiers in AI and Science](https://youtu.be/PONzwb_mAS8)“
* Samantha Riesenfeld – “[Mathematical Models for Single-Cell Genomic Data: Challenges and Opportunities](https://youtu.be/g1DnOhqgoys)” (*note: due to technical difficulties, video starts halfway through talk*)
* Miles Stoudenmire – “[Tensor Networks in Machine Learning Architectures](https://youtu.be/WbBeX-PN57g)“
* Roman Garnett – “[Bayesian Active Learning For Experimental Design](https://youtu.be/OxeVDwF4D_k)“

# Camille Avestruz

Assistant Professor of Physics, University of Michigan

Dr. Avestruz's research interests span astrophysics, cosmology, and computation. Dr. Avestruz uses simulations to make robust predictions and interpretations of observations of large-scale cosmic structure. Her primary focus is to understand the evolution of clusters of galaxies, the most massive gravitationally collapsed structures in our universe, comprised of hundreds to thousands of galaxies. Other aspects of her work prepare for the next decade of observations, which will produce unprecedented volumes of data. Dr. Avestruz incorporates big data methods, including machine learning, to extract gravitational lensing signatures that probe the mass distribution of massive galaxies and galaxy clusters.

Dr. Avestruz is passionate about making STEM accessible to those who have been historically excluded from the sciences and the academy. She has taught software and computation workshops to a variety of audiences ranging from undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) groups to societies promoting the advancement of underrepresented minorities in STEM. She has also engaged in public outreach, believing that intellectual exchange is not and should not be isolated within the walls and members of higher education. This includes teaching labs to students from local middle and high schools and giving public talks at Astronomy on Tap and to underserved elderly communities.

# Aaron Schein (Columbia) – Measurement and Experimentation in Complex Sociopolitical Processes

March 10, 2022 4:30 PM – 5:30 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 390

[Watch Via Live Stream](http://live.cs.uchicago.edu/aaronschein/)

Complex social and political processes at many scales—from interpersonal networks of friends to international networks of countries—are a central theme of computational social science. Modern methods of data science that can contend with the complexity of data from such processes have the potential to break ground on long-standing questions of critical relevance to public policy. In this talk, I will present two lines of work on 1) estimating the causal effects of friend-to-friend mobilization in US elections, and 2) inferring complex latent structure in dyadic event data of country-to-country interactions. In the first part, I will discuss recent work using large-scale digital field experiments on the mobile app Outvote to estimate the causal effects of friend-to-friend texting on voter turnout in the 2018 and 2020 US elections. This work is among the first to rigorously assess the effectiveness of friend-to-friend “get out the vote” tactics, which political campaigns have increasingly embraced in recent elections. I will discuss the statistical challenges inherent to randomizing interactions between friends with a “light touch” design and will describe the methodology we developed to identify and precisely estimate causal effects. In the second part of this talk, I will discuss hierarchical Bayesian modeling of dyadic event data sets in international relations which contain millions of micro-records of the form “country i took action a to country j at time t”. The models I will discuss blend elements of tensor decomposition and dynamical systems to capture complex temporal and network dependence structure in the data. Approximate posterior inference relies on new auxiliary variable augmentation schemes and theorems about the properties and relationships between different discrete distributions. At the end of the talk, I will outline the future of both lines of work, as well as their intersection, and sketch a broader vision for how data science can serve computational social science and vice versa.

**!Bio**: [Aaron Schein](https://www.aaronschein.com/) is a postdoctoral fellow in the Data Science Institute at Columbia University, where he is co-advised by David Blei and Donald Green. His research develops machine learning and data science methods for computational social science. His recent work uses large-scale digital field experiments to assess the causal effects of friend-to-friend mobilization on voter turnout in US elections. Aaron did his PhD at UMass Amherst in Computer Science, where he was advised by Hanna Wallach. His doctoral research developed new hierarchical Bayesian models, tensor decomposition methods, and dynamical systems for analyzing massive data sets of country-to-country events. Aaron has interned at Google and Microsoft Research and worked in policy at the MITRE Corporation. He is also currently a senior technical advisor at Ocurate and a research affiliate at PredictWise. Prior to doing his PhD, he received a BA in Political Science and an MA in Computational Linguistics from UMass Amherst. He is on Twitter @AaronSchein.

Distributional assumptions are ubiquitous in machine learning and underlie the development of core algorithms for supervised learning. Testing even the most basic distributional assumptions, however, is often statistically intractable.  In these scenarios, it is unclear how to verify the performance of an efficient learning algorithm on a given training set, undercutting the entire notion of provable correctness.

This motivates the recently introduced model of Testable Learning due Rubinfeld and Vasilyan where the goal is to replace hard-to-verify distributional assumptions with efficiently testable ones and to require that the learner succeed whenever the unknown distribution passes the corresponding test.  In this talk, we discuss a series of works establishing a powerful framework for algorithm design in this model and show, surprisingly, that the sample complexity is tightly characterized by the Rademacher complexity of the underlying function class.

Time permitting, we will discuss some core research directions at IFML, the National AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning (ifml.institute).

**Abstract:** Accurate quantitative predictions concerning reactions in molecular systems are fundamental to chemistry and are of practical importance for designing the next generations of catalysts, materials for sustainable energy, therapeutics, and molecular sensors, to name just a few examples. Traditional kinetic theories assume a well-defined activated complex (transition state) and a simple form for the underlying (free) energy landscape governing the dynamics. However, reactions in complex systems typically studied today involve many intermediates and competing pathways. New computational methods are needed to describe such dynamics. I will discuss how machine learning can be leveraged to elucidate reaction mechanisms and their kinetics from time series data and show examples from my group’s work on proteins.

!**Bio: Aaron Dinner is a Professor of Chemistry and Deputy Dean of the Physical Sciences Division at the University of Chicago.** He obtained his A.B. in Biochemical Sciences in 1994 and his Ph.D. in Biophysics in 1999, both from Harvard University. Following postdoctoral research at Oxford University from 1999 to 2001 and University of California, Berkeley from 2001 to 2003, he joined the faculty at the University of Chicago in 2003. From 2012 to 2018, he served as the Director of the James Franck Institute, a longstanding interdisciplinary institute bringing together research in condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics; biophysics; and physical chemistry. His research seeks to understand how the complex behaviors of living systems arise from molecular interactions. To this end, he and his group have developed and deployed simulation and machine learning algorithms for characterizing rare events, with a focus on molecular transitions. They have also worked closely with experimentalists to analyze biological measurements and formulate models of processes that enable self-organization in space and time, including cell-fate choices during development and activation of the immune system, timing of the bacterial cell cycle, circadian rhythms, and cytoskeletal dynamics. His honors include a Searle Scholarship, National Science Foundation CAREER Award, Sloan Fellowship, and an American Physical Society Fellowship.

# AI & Science Summer School 2023

July 17 – 21, 2023

Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation

!                                      !

Modern artificial intelligence and machine learning will fundamentally change scientific discovery. We are just beginning to understand the possibilities presented by an era of extraordinarily powerful computers coupled with advanced instruments capable of collecting enormous volumes of high-resolution experimental data. Off-the-shelf machine learning tools cannot fully extract the knowledge contained in these datasets, let alone generate new theories and propose future experiments.

The [AI + Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/) Summer School will be held from **July 17th – 21st**, jointly hosted by the [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.uchicago.edu) (DSI), the [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/) (IMSI) at the University of Chicago, and [Schmidt Futures](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/) via our [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellowship program](http://aiscience.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago.

This year’s speakers will focus on applications of AI and Machine learning in core areas of domain science – materials and chemistry, physics, climate change and biology. The goal of the program is to introduce a new generation of diverse interdisciplinary graduate students and researchers to the emerging field of AI + Science. We also hope this program can build community and spur new research directions focused on AI-enabled scientific discovery across the physical and biological sciences.

[Lecture Slide Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NGHVrhksp5bnjWajNWhsdyi9MZZBnA_t/view?usp=drive_link)

**Abstract:**

Pursuing answers to fundamental questions about our universe requires searches for the ultra-rare, very subtle, and the inspection of nature at extremely fine spatial and temporal scales.  Cutting edge experiments are often confronted with massive amounts of very rich data.  To accelerate scientific discovery, enabling powerful machine learning across the data processing continuum, from sensor front-ends to large scale computing, is becoming increasingly valuable.  To deploy ML in these challenging scientific environments, we require usable and accessible tool flows for efficient training and implementation across a broad range of scientific domains.  This talk will introduce the motivations and requirements for “Fast” ML applications for science and how we use modern tools and techniques for developing and deploying them into our experiments.

**Bio:**

Tran’s research focus is on using accelerator-based experiments, such as CMS at the LHC, to search for new phenomena. His current activities center on the Higgs boson and dark sectors experiments. He is developing technology at the intersection of electronics, computing, and artificial intelligence to amplify experimental capabilities. He was a postdoctoral associate at Fermilab, and prior to that he received his PhD from Johns Hopkins University in 2011 and his bachelor’s degree from Princeton University in 2005. Tran is a recipient of the URA Tollestrup Award, the APS Henry Primakoff Award, and the DOE Early Career Award.

**Abstract:**

Machine learning accelerated catalyst discovery efforts have seen much progress in the last few years. Large-scale data and machine learning modeling efforts like the Open Catalyst Project ([https://opencatalystproject.org/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://opencatalystproject.org/__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!40Klos3-fxpKfIXFSiRVCqWEE9fXP--CGyTrBokidGbi7b-hRUygId8Mf7rHyMJMQQpcrgh5MPszNk82$), open source data/models at [https://fair-chem.github.io/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://fair-chem.github.io/__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!40Klos3-fxpKfIXFSiRVCqWEE9fXP--CGyTrBokidGbi7b-hRUygId8Mf7rHyMJMQQpcrgh5MB-rUo9i$)) have elevated computational catalysis to a first-class problem in the broader machine learning community and led to rapid improvements in accuracy with new state-of-the-art AI/ML models appearing every 3-4 months since 2020. Similar efforts are under way for other climate-related materials challenges like direct air capture via the OpenDAC collaboration ([https://open-dac.github.io/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://open-dac.github.io/__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!40Klos3-fxpKfIXFSiRVCqWEE9fXP--CGyTrBokidGbi7b-hRUygId8Mf7rHyMJMQQpcrgh5MABHcfhk$)).

In the first session I will highlight some of the recent FAIR Chemistry datasets and model efforts, and then review and discuss metrics and evaluation criteria for uncertainty quantification in these large models. I will then review some of the common and emerging methods in the literature to provide uncertainty estimates, especially with an eye on computational trade-offs (sources of uncertainty, training, inference, etc).

[Presentation Slide Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n5UodwBYXKFn8uiv1niInxQqguuXSuIP/view?usp=drive_link)

**Abstract:**

The workshop will teach attendees how to convert microscopy images into “image-based” or “morphological profiles”, similar to proteomic or transcriptomic profiles. These morphological profiles are created by measuring cellular features from the microscopic images. The profiles generated from cells treated with chemical or genetic perturbations can be used to identify similarities and differences between the “treated” cells and control groups. Interestingly, this approach can also reveal unexpected biological relationships between the treated groups and the features driving these relationships. These profile relationships can be visualized using Morpheus, a web-based software, or with Google Colab Notebooks. 

**Bio:**

I am a postdoctoral associate in Beth Cimini’s lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. My background is in Cell and Molecular Biology, and I gained experience in advanced microscopes during my research on intermediate filaments at Robert Goldman’s lab at Northwestern University. This expertise in advanced microscopes led me to the fascinating field of image analysis in biology. Currently, in Cimini’s lab, I develop image analysis pipelines using CellProfiler, ImageJ, cellpose, ilastik, and other image analysis tools to help our collaborators analyze their images. I also develop custom-trained deep learning models when the pre-trained models are not enough.

[Presentation Slide Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O2eWhxKXu650Kw_-MbuJ25T8bhYdMYAp/view?usp=sharing)

**Abstract:**

Using Machine Learning in Predicting Drug Properties

This workshop will provide an in-depth exploration of human pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters crucial for evaluating drug toxicity, emphasizing the integration of cheminformatics and machine learning techniques. Participants will gain a thorough understanding of fundamental PK parameters such as volume of distribution (VDss), clearance (CL), half-life (t½), fraction unbound in plasma (fu), and mean residence time (MRT). The course introduces chemical structural fingerprints, physicochemical properties, and cell morphology data, including Cell Painting data, essential for cheminformatics prediction tasks. Key learning objectives include acquiring hands-on experience with machine learning models like Random Forests to predict compound properties and validating these models using cross-validation and evaluation metrics such as balanced accuracy and AUC-ROC. Attendees will also explore the real-world application of predicted PK parameters and cell morphology data in liver toxicity evaluation. Participants will engage in a hands-on workshop using Google Colab Notebooks to predict liver toxicity, focusing on data standardization, feature selection, model implementation, validation, and result interpretation.

#### Muratahan Aykol (Google DeepMind) Lecture

**Abstract:**

Traditional methods for advancing materials science are costly and rely heavily on human intuition. In the first part of this lecture, I will showcase how machine learning algorithms can be used in a closed-loop setting to accelerate materials research by recasting research problems as optimization tasks. With several examples, we will discuss how experiments or computations could be driven by such algorithms without much human input. In the second part of the lecture, I will discuss applications of such methods in greater detail for specific research topics of materials discovery and predictive synthesis.

**Bio:**

Dr. Aykol is a researcher at Google DeepMind working at the intersection of materials science and machine learning. Prior to his current role, he led a Battery Data Science team at Rivian and spent many years at Toyota Research Institute as a research scientist and a founding member of the materials division. Murat received his PhD in Computational Materials Science from Northwestern University under the supervision of Prof. Chris Wolverton, and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Berkeley Lab in the Materials Project team led by Prof. Kristin Persson. His current research interests include AI for materials discovery, thermochemistry and phase diagram calculations with application areas ranging from finding better energy materials to enabling predictive synthesis of new compounds. He has authored close to 100 papers and patents in such subject areas.

**Abstract:**

Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have made substantial impacts in multiple areas of science, providing high-accuracy models that accelerate predictions and gather insights from complex data. Particularly in the last decade, deep learning has emerged as a successful way to create functions between arbitrary inputs and outputs with the use of neural networks (NNs). Despite their immense practical utility, NNs typically suffer from the “Clever Hans” effect and make predictions based on spurious correlations in the data. In addition, some NN models lack robustness to perturbations and extrapolation conditions. In this lecture, I will describe recent advances in uncertainty quantification (UQ), model robustness, and explainability for scientific machine learning (SciML). Starting with traditional UQ methods, I will review trade-offs, applications, and implementations of these methods in a range of model architectures. I will also describe how NNs are susceptible to adversarial attacks and in extrapolation conditions, which is particularly complicated for scientific AI. Finally, I will describe how interpretability methods can help improve models and discovery of new principles in SciML. Examples and demonstrations across fields will be provided, with a focus on the physical and chemical sciences.

**Abstract:**

AI and the 2nd Revolution in Weather and Climate Prediction

In recent years, there has been substantial interest in using machine learning (ML), especially deep neural networks (NNs), to improve the modeling and prediction of complex, multiscale, nonlinear dynamical systems such as turbulent flows and Earth’s climate. Remarkable success in performing 1 to 10-day weather prediction with NN-based models has been demonstrated in the past two years, referred to as the 2nd revolution in weather forecasting. There are also efforts focused on revolutionizing long-term climate predictions, particularly for predicting climate change, using AI-based parameterizations and AI climate emulators. I will highlight some of the achievements and promising results, as well as some of the outstanding questions and current shortcomings of AI-based weather and climate models. Prominent examples include the challenges these models face in dealing with very rare events, learning multi-scale chaotic dynamics, and addressing non-stationarity (e.g., a changing climate). I will discuss ideas around integrating ML theory, climate/nonlinear physics, and computational and applied math techniques to make progress toward addressing these challenges.

**Abstract:**

This lecture will be focused on the area of observational cosmology and how different AI/ML tools has been incorporated into our daily lives. In the first hour we will give some background on the big science questions that are relevant in cosmology and how the field has made progress in the past 20 years using observational data. I will introduce here a variety of AI/ML applications that has been used going back to the early days of machine learning. In the second hour I will talk about a new wave of AI/ML applications to cosmology problems that have been emerging in the past couple years thanks to the technical advances, and how that affected the field. I will then circle back to the theme of this summer school and to discuss a little practical things we can do to have science and AI truely advance each other. 

This lecture will not have a hands-on tutorial component, but I will provide some resources for those who may be interested in looking into the tools introduced in the lecture. We will also have small-group discussions throughout the lecture to help people flesh out and exchange ideas.

[Tess Smidt Partial Lecture Video](https://youtu.be/rqWj3uR6V2w?si=NONSEloefN8gyrXX)

**Abstract:**

 A Primer on 3D Euclidean Neural Networks

Representing the locations and orientations of objects in 3D space typically involves using coordinates and coordinate systems. This poses a challenge for machine learning due to the sensitivity of coordinates to 3D rotations, translations, and inversions (the symmetries of 3D Euclidean space). Euclidean symmetry-equivariant Neural Networks (E(3)NNs) are specifically designed to address this issue. They faithfully capture the symmetries of physical systems, handle 3D geometry, and operate on the scalar, vector, and tensor fields that characterize these systems.

E(3)NNs have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on diverse atomistic benchmarks, such as small molecule properties, protein-ligand binding, and force prediction for heterogeneous catalysis. These networks combine neural network operations with insights from group representation theory. Their success stems from a rigorous foundation, making them more robust, data-efficient, and capable of generalization compared to invariant or non-equivariant neural networks.

In this talk, I will give an overview of the theory behind E(3)NNs and how they are used for diverse tasks in the physical sciences. I’ll also connect how the building blocks of E(3)NNs generalize to other symmetry-equivariant architectures.

[Presentation link](https://github.com/atomicarchitects/symphony/tree/tutorial/tutorial)

**Abstract:**

Symphony-Equivariant Point-Centered Spherical Harmonics for 3D Molecule Generation  
  
This tutorial will provide an introduction to E(3)-equivariant neural networks for the task of autoregressive 3D molecule generation. First, we will describe a simple approach for 3D molecule generation, and show why E(3)-equivariance is a useful property for a model to have in this setting. Next, we introduce NequIP, an E(3)-equivariant message-passing network, explaining how the 3D geometry of molecular fragments can be processed efficiently.

Then, we introduce the spherical harmonics, and how they can be used to parametrize angular distributions efficiently. Finally, we combine all of these ingredients to create Symphony, our new autoregressive model. We demonstrate the model’s predictive capabilities on QM9, a dataset of small organic molecules. This tutorial will also introduce participants to JAX, a differentiable programming framework in Python. We end with a discussion of interesting research directions in this space.

# AI+Science Hackathon

May 6 – 9, 2024

!The Data Science Institute and the Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellows program at the University of Chicago are hosting an innovative hackathon challenging you to apply AI and machine learning methods to solve pressing scientific problems. The hackathon will take place **May 6-9th** on the University of Chicago campus.

**Hackathon Highlights:**

– ***Two Projects**:* Competitors will have the opportunity to work on one of two projects. The first project will focus on molecular modeling using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict interactions within molecules. The second project will focus on using classification, regression, and generative modeling to understand the lives and deaths of massive stars.

– ***Team Competition**:* Each team will have **4 members**. Participants can sign up as individuals or as groups of up to 4. Individuals or groups of less than 4 will be matched with others.

– ***M******entorship**:*Each team will be assigned a mentor from the Schmidt fellows program to provide guidance and support throughout the hackathon.

**First Project Overview:**

> **Unlock the Secrets of Molecules with AI**
>
> Dive into the world of molecular modeling where atoms and bonds form the essence of everything around us. We invite undergraduate and graduate students to embark on an exciting journey to decipher these microscopic puzzles using the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our innovative challenge leverages AI to predict the intricate interactions within molecules, transcending traditional methods with a blend of precision and computational efficiency.
>
> Join us in this cutting-edge hackathon, where you’ll apply GNNs to model molecules as complex graphs, drawing insights from the vast ChEMBL database. This isn’t just about simulations; it’s about pioneering a future where we understand the very fabric of molecular behavior. Are you ready to redefine the boundaries of molecular simulations? Gear up for a challenge that promises to ignite your creativity and sharpen your skills in AI and molecular science.

**Second Project Overview:**

> **Predicting the Lives and Deaths of Stellar Binaries**
>
> Most stars in the Universe have at least one companion, with the most common configuration being pairs. Astronomers observe these binaries at all stages of their lives to learn about the physical processes underlying their evolution. These observations are then compared with theoretical predictions from computationally expensive simulations known as “population synthesis.”
>
> The goal of this project is to develop novel ways to explore the outputs of these simulations. This dataset provides many opportunities ranging from classification and regression to generative modelling that will enhance our ability to understand these extreme astrophysical systems.

**Eligibility:**

Open to all University of Chicago undergraduate and graduate students. If you are a staff member or postdoctoral fellow and are interested in participating, please get in touch with us.

**Abstract:** Inspired by the mysteries and structural connectivity of the brain, John Hopfield developed general class of learning networks, which are both used as a model to understand brain function and mimic its computational capabilities for an enormous diversity of uses. Here, I will use as inspiration Waddington’s metaphor for the robustness of evolved systems behaving as a ball rolling down in a canalized landscape that is held up by a complex network of genetic factors. I will present 3 recent investigations from our team ([1](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.21.614191v1__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!80Eok6AuYF-hvZsPby3F2iwJ6161RopjXWWHxJvGTVlaj-0bJKR9Zc9klDqMzFvTS7I8Ot0Vud3A6sZfcB_MZVM$), [2](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.26.605398v2__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!80Eok6AuYF-hvZsPby3F2iwJ6161RopjXWWHxJvGTVlaj-0bJKR9Zc9klDqMzFvTS7I8Ot0Vud3A6sZflJBDzTA$), and [3](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.033098__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!80Eok6AuYF-hvZsPby3F2iwJ6161RopjXWWHxJvGTVlaj-0bJKR9Zc9klDqMzFvTS7I8Ot0Vud3A6sZfe95_hwE$)) where we leverage neural networks to study the origins and consequences of this powerful dynamical systems analogy in the context of the dynamics of cellular, embryonic, and MNIST digit differentiation.

**Abstract:** Fluid flows often exhibit chaotic or turbulent dynamics, and require a large number of degrees of freedom for accurate simulation. Nevertheless, because of the fast damping of small scales by viscosity, these flows can in principle be represented with many fewer dimensions, as their long-time dynamics relax in state space to a finite-dimensional invariant manifold. Classical data-driven methods for dimension reduction approximate this manifold as a flat surface, but for complex systems, this approach is severely limited.  We describe a data-driven reduced order modeling method,  “Data-driven Manifold Dynamics” (DManD), that finds a nonlinear coordinate representation of the manifold using a machine-learning architecture called an autoencoder, then learns a neural ordinary differential equation for the dynamics on the manifold. Exploitation of symmetries substantially improves performance. We apply DManD to a range of systems including transitional turbulence, where we accurately represent the dynamics with 25 degrees of freedom, as compared to the 105 degrees of freedom of the direct simulation. We then use the model to efficiently train a reinforcement learning control policy that is highly effective in laminarizing the flow. We also describe an autoencoder architecture that yields an explicit estimate of manifold dimension.  Finally, we describe recent work on the relationship between neural ODE and Koopman operator approaches to prediction of time evolution in complex nonlinear systems. We demonstrate that a common implementation of a Koopman-operator-based approach, extended dynamic mode decomposition with dictionary learning (EDMD-DL), is equivalent to a neural network representation of the nonlinear discrete-time flow map on the state space.

# Alex Kale (U. of Washington) – Data Interfaces for Reasoning with Uncertainty

March 3, 2022 2:00 PM – 3:00 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 390

[Watch Via Live Stream](http://live.cs.uchicago.edu/alexkale/)

The need to think with data permeates our world today, yet failures to account for how people reason with uncertainty undermine some of our current approaches to thinking with data. For example, the status quo in public-facing visualizations (e.g., of Covid-19, election forecasts, or economic indicators) is to present data without making uncertainty information explicit, catering to people’s natural tendencies to ignore or downplay uncertainty. Even when we do quantify uncertainty and show it in data visualizations—e.g., as error bars depicting a range of expected outcomes—lay audiences and statistically savvy analysts alike tend to misinterpret these visual representations. I will describe how I address these problems: (1) by creating formalisms and experiments to capture what makes reasoning with uncertainty difficult in the context of real-world tasks like decision making, and (2) by building prototypes of data analysis software to test design hypotheses derived from empirical findings and theories of data cognition. Together, these formalisms and tools advance theories of what makes a visualization effective, beyond the ability to easily read numbers from charts. I will demonstrate how visualizations and data analysis tools can promote new ways of thinking with uncertainty that are less error prone. Throughout my talk, I will challenge conventional assumptions about how people use visualizations, opening the door to new ways of designing and building software for data analysis.

**!Bio**: [Alex Kale](http://students.washington.edu/kalea/) is a PhD candidate at the University of Washington Information School and a visiting scholar in Computer Science at Northwestern University. He studies how people reason with uncertainty in data visualizations and analysis software, developing formalisms to bridge software evaluation and design. Alex publishes in top Human-Computer Interaction and Visualization venues such as ACM CHI and IEEE VIS, where his work won Best Paper and Honorable Mention Awards. Alex’s work demonstrates gaps in dominant theories and models of what makes a visualization effective for inferences and decision making. Alex will finish his PhD in June of 2022. He holds a B.S. in Psychology with Honors (2015) and a M.S. in Information Science (2020) from the University of Washington.

**Abstract:** Life and environmental sciences generate vast amounts of biomolecular data, from genomes to environmental measurements. While these data offer valuable insights, their quality heterogeneity limits their use in comparative analyses and the identification of key signals. A critical challenge—spanning health and environmental sciences—is identifying discriminant biomarkers between ecosystems using diversity measures (metabarcoding). Although machine learning can highlight characteristic species biomarkers, its performance declines when shifting from species identification (“who”) to functional explanations (“why”), leading to reduced classification accuracy.

This presentation explores how combining symbolic data science (knowledge management and reasoning over dynamical systems) with machine learning enhances the analysis of large, heterogeneous data. This approach improves flexibility, robustness, performance, and interpretability in metabarcoding. Applications include identifying species driving key functions in bioreactors, classifying patients by microbiome composition, and pinpointing essential species in extreme environments based on their functions.

**!**

**Bio: Anne Siegel, Deputy Scientific Director, CNRS.** Anne graduated from the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon and is a research director in computer science at the CNRS. Following her thesis in mathematics, her research focused in theoretical computer sciences and then shifted to bioinformatics, at the IRISA laboratory (Institute For Research In IT And Random Systems), where she develops methods combining dynamic systems analysis and reasoning on data and knowledge to model in silico the capacity of species to produce molecules of interest in the context of various interdisciplinary programs.

She created and directed the research team Dyliss in her laboratory, then headed a department of the laboratory, before becoming Deputy Scientific Director of the CNRS division of Information Sciences and their Interaction (INS2I). At CNRS-INS2I, she promotes interdisicplinarity between computer sciences and other disciplines, she monitors research networks, and is in charge of the gender-equality policy.

# Been Kim (Google DeepMind) – Alignment and interpretability: how we might get it right

November 19, 2024 2:00 PM – 3:00 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 390

*Part of the 2024-25 DSI [Distinguished Speaker Series](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/2024-25-distinguished-speaker-series/) and the [Computer Science Distinguished Lecture Series](https://cs.uchicago.edu/events/event/distinguished-lecture-series-been-kim-google-deepmind-alignment-and-interpretability-how-we-might-get-it-right/).*

The main goal of interpretability is to enable communication between humans and machines, whether it’s a value, knowledge, or an objective. In this talk, I argue that a better way to enable this communication is for humans to expand what they know and learn new things. Doing so enables us to also expand what machines know—by building better-aligned machines. I share why considering the representational gap is crucial in solving the alignment problem, and I provide an example of bridging the knowledge gap.

!Bio: Been Kim is a senior staff research scientist at Google DeepMind. Her research focuses on helping humans to communicate with complex machine learning models: 1) building tools to aid human’s collaboration with machines (and detect when those tools fail) 2) study machines’ general nature and 3) leveraging machines’ knowledge to benefit humans. She gave a talk at the G20 meeting in Argentina in 2019 and a keynote at ICLR 2022 and ECML 2020. Her work TCAV received UNESCO Netexplo award, was featured at Google I/O 19′. Her work is in a chapter of Brian Christian’s book on “The Alignment Problem”. She is the General chair at ICLR2024, was a Senior Program Chair at ICLR 2023 and advisory board at TRAILS. She has been a senior area chair at NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AISTATS and others for the past few years. She is a steering committee member of FAccT conference and SATML. She received her Ph.D. from MIT.

# Bo Li (UIUC) – Trustworthy Federated Learning: Robustness, Fairness, Privacy, and Their Interconnections

October 7, 2022 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM

*Part of the [Autumn 2022 Distinguished Speaker Series](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/autumn-2022-distinguished-speaker-series/).*

Advances in machine learning have led to rapid and widespread deployment of ML algorithms for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics. Current machine learning systems, however, assume that training and test data follow the same, or similar, distributions, and do not consider active adversaries manipulating either distribution. Recent work has demonstrated that motivated adversaries can circumvent ML detection models at test time through evasion attacks, or inject well-crafted malicious instances into training data to induce errors during inference through poisoning attacks, especially in the distributed setting. In this talk, I will describe my recent research about security, privacy, and fairness problems in federated learning, with a focus on certifiably robust federated learning against training-time attacks, fairness, and the interconnection between robustness and privacy in federated learning. I will also discuss other defense principles towards developing practical trustworthy federated learning systems with guarantees.

**Bio**: Dr. Bo Li is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. She is the recipient of the IJCAI Computers and Thought Award, Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, NSF CAREER Award, MIT Technology Review TR-35 Award, Dean’s Award for Excellence in Research, C.W. Gear Outstanding Junior Faculty Award, Intel Rising Star award, Symantec Research Labs Fellowship, Rising Star Award, Research Awards from Tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and IBM, and best paper awards at several top machine learning and security conferences. Her research focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects of trustworthy machine learning, security, machine learning, privacy, and game theory. She has designed several scalable frameworks for trustworthy machine learning and privacy-preserving data publishing systems. Her work has been featured by major publications and media outlets such as Nature, Wired, Fortune, and New York Times.

**Getting Inference Right with LLM Annotations in the Social Sciences: A General Framework of Using Predicted Variables in Downstream Analysis**

Text as data methods, including large language models (LLMs), have allowed social scientists to measure a wide range of properties of documents. While such predicted text-based variables are often analyzed as if they were observed without errors, we show that ignoring prediction errors leads to substantial bias and invalid confidence intervals in downstream analyses, even if the accuracy of the automated annotation step is high, e.g., above 90%. We propose a framework of design-based supervised learning (DSL) that can provide valid statistical estimates, even when predicted variables contain non-random prediction errors. DSL employs a doubly robust procedure to combine predicted labels and a smaller number of high-quality expert annotations. DSL allows scholars to apply advances in LLMs and natural language processing to social science research while maintaining statistical validity. We illustrate its general applicability using two applications where the outcome and independent variables are text-based. This work is joint with Naoki Egami, Musashi Hinck, and Hanying Wei. I will conclude the talk with a broader view of how we can think about the best use of LLMs in the social sciences.

**Bio**: [Brandon Stewart](https://sociology.princeton.edu/people/brandon-stewart) is an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology and is also affiliated with the Department of Politics and the Office of Population Research.  He develops new quantitative statistical methods for applications across the social sciences.  Methodologically his focus is in tools which facilitate automated text analysis and model complex heterogeneity in regression.  Many recent applications of these methods have centered on using large corpora of text to better understand propaganda in contemporary China.  His research has been published in journals such as American Journal of Political Science, Political Analysis and the Proceedings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.  His work has won the Edward R Chase Dissertation Prize, the Gosnell Prize for Excellence in Political Methodology, and the Political Analysis Editor’s Choice Award.

**Abstract:** Over the past decade, venture capital (VC) firms have begun investing heavily in deeptech startups tackling global challenges such as decarbonization with high-risk, high-reward research. According to a report from the Boston Consulting Group[1], as of late 2023, deeptech accounts for 20% of all VC investment, and delivers financial returns on par with traditional VC funds. These developments are great news for aspiring entrepreneurs in academia, as university researchers are well-positioned to launch deeptech ventures.

In this talk, I will discuss my own deeptech startup journey as founding CEO and later Chief Science Officer of Citrine Informatics, a leading provider of AI for the materials industry. I will cover how the founding team came together, how we iterated toward product-market fit, and how Citrine evolved from a small startup to an established, growth-stage software company. I will also describe some key business and leadership learnings gained as a scientific entrepreneur along the path from a Ph.D. to an MBA to launching a rapidly growing Silicon Valley startup.

[PER-GUNNAR MARTINSSON](https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~pgm/), Department of Mathematics and the Oden Institute, University of Texas at Austin.

[“Randomized Algorithms for Linear Algebraic Computations”](https://d3qi0qp55mx5f5.cloudfront.net/cam/docs/CAM-Colloquium/2023-24/Martinsson__Per-Gunnar_110223.pdf?mtime=1697735311)

The talk will describe how randomized algorithms can effectively, accurately, and reliably solve linear algebraic problems that are omnipresent in scientific computing and in data analysis. We will focus on techniques for low rank approximation, since these methods are particularly simple and powerful. The talk will also briefly survey a number of other randomized algorithms for tasks such as solving linear systems, estimating matrix norms, and computing full matrix factorizations.

**Fairness in Visual Recognition**

Computer vision models trained on unparalleled amounts of data hold promise for making impartial, well-informed decisions in a variety of applications. However, more and more historical societal biases are making their way into these seemingly innocuous systems.  We focus our attention on bias in the form of inappropriate correlations between visual protected attributes (age, gender expression, skin color, …) and the predictions of visual recognition models, as well as any unintended discrepancy in error rates of vision systems across different social, demographic or cultural groups. In this talk, we’ll dive deeper both into the technical reasons and the potential solutions for bias in computer vision. I’ll highlight our recent work addressing bias in visual datasets (FAT\*2020 [http://image-net.org/filtering-and-balancing/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://image-net.org/filtering-and-balancing/__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!oTUpIfwafT4fQMgCqUdo-Ux3Qa52MuuaWkfmghTEXhg6_FbYhMzmcCdtBP787mfk4Q4$); ECCV 2020 [https://github.com/princetonvisualai/revise-tool](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/princetonvisualai/revise-tool__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!oTUpIfwafT4fQMgCqUdo-Ux3Qa52MuuaWkfmghTEXhg6_FbYhMzmcCdtBP78YDXu1J0$)), in visual models (CVPR 2020 [https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11834](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11834__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!oTUpIfwafT4fQMgCqUdo-Ux3Qa52MuuaWkfmghTEXhg6_FbYhMzmcCdtBP78UMXrauU$); under review [https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01469](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01469__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!oTUpIfwafT4fQMgCqUdo-Ux3Qa52MuuaWkfmghTEXhg6_FbYhMzmcCdtBP78ryuQB2A$)) as well as in the makeup of AI leadership ([http://ai-4-all.org](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://ai-4-all.org__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!oTUpIfwafT4fQMgCqUdo-Ux3Qa52MuuaWkfmghTEXhg6_FbYhMzmcCdtBP78Ix1Pjcc$)).

**Bias Correction: Solutions for Socially Responsible Data Science**

Security, privacy and bias in the context of machine learning are often treated as binary issues, where an algorithm is either biased or fair, ethical or unjust. In reality, there is a tradeoff between using technology and opening up new privacy and security risks. Researchers are developing innovative tools that navigate these tradeoffs by applying advances in machine learning to societal issues without exacerbating bias or endangering privacy and security. The CDAC Winter 2021 Distinguished Speaker Series will host interdisciplinary researchers and thinkers exploring methods and applications that protect user privacy, prevent malicious use, and avoid deepening societal inequities — while diving into the human values and decisions that underpin these approaches.

The **Internet Of Things (IoT)** market is predicted to grow at $520B in valuation by 2021, more than double the $235B spent in 2017, according to Forbes. The increasing popularity of these “smart” IoT consumer devices raises many interesting research questions. At the [CDAC IoT Lab](/iot-lab), we replicate your home broadband network inside an experimental laboratory to study security, privacy, and network performance. By hosting several IoT devices (powered by [CableLabs](https://www.cablelabs.com/)), we provide a unique opportunity for you to experiment with new and existing datasets, apply data science and machine learning techniques to uncover new insights and valuable information, or build your new application or research project.

At this workshop, we’ll provide a tour of the devices and tools available in the CDAC IoT Lab, and show you how to access and analyze the data these devices collect, both in our workspace and in your own home. The workshop runs one hour, and **space is very limited**, so [please sign up for either the 3pm or 4pm slot](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cdac-iot-lab-workshop-tickets-88907393407). [1/14 UPDATE: The event is full, but you can sign up for the waitlist or fill out the form [here](/iot-lab/) for information on future session.]

Read about our research on IoT devices and networks in [NPR](/insights/science-friday-your-smart-tv-is-watching-you/), [Wall Street Journal](/news/nick-feamsters-research-drives-wall-street-journal-investigation-of-streaming-video/), and the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/18/you-watch-tv-your-tv-watches-back/).

**Abstract:** Rechargeable batteries are pivotal in addressing many of society’s decarbonization goals. Unfortunately, developing new rechargeable battery chemistries can take decades. A big reason why is the infinite chemical space one must traverse to find a battery material that works. In this talk, I will focus on a battery material called the electrolyte. The electrolyte consists of salts dissolved in solvents (at different concentrations, in different mixtures); hence the chemical space is practically infinite. We have pursued a data-driven approach for electrolyte discovery. I will give three vignettes about (1) our development of forward design models that can map electrolyte composition to a property prediction. We show highly accurate models for the prediction of three important electrolyte properties (ionic conductivity, oxidative stability, and Coulombic efficiency. (2) development of active learning models paired with experimental feedback to smartly navigate the chemical space and increase the diversity of high performing electrolytes. Finally, (3) our newest work on generative models to map electrolyte properties to electrolyte composition.

**!Bio: Chibueze Amanchukwu** is a Neubauer Family Assistant Professor in the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago and holds a joint appointment at Argonne National Laboratory. His research is focused on enabling long duration electrical (batteries) and chemical energy storage for a sustainable energy future. His team is especially interested in modifying electrolyte and ion solvation behavior to control electrochemical processes occurring in batteries and electrocatalytic transformations such as carbon dioxide capture and conversion. They couple data science, computation, synthesis, and characterization to holistically understand ion transport in electrolytes and control interfacial reactions for efficient and cheap long duration storage.

His work has been recognized with the NSF CAREER Award, DOE Early Career Award, ECS-Toyota Young Investigator Fellowship, CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar Award, and the 3M Nontenured Faculty Award. He obtained his PhD in chemical engineering as a NDSEG Fellow at MIT and was a TomKat Center Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University.

**Abstract:** We live in an increasingly interconnected world, with many organizations operating across countries or even continents. To serve their global user base, organizations are replacing their legacy DBMSs with cloud-based systems capable of scaling OLTP workloads to millions of users. CockroachDB is a scalable SQL DBMS that was built from the ground up to support these global OLTP workloads while maintaining high availability and strong consistency. Just like its namesake, CockroachDB is resilient to disasters through replication and automatic recovery mechanisms.

In this talk, I’ll give an overview of the architecture of CockroachDB and its novel transaction model that supports consistent geo-distributed transactions without the use of specialized hardware. I will describe how CockroachDB replicates and distributes data to achieve fault tolerance and high performance, as well as how its distributed SQL layer automatically scales with the size of the database cluster while providing the standard SQL interface that users expect. I’ll share some of the work we’ve done to improve the experience of users building applications on CockroachDB that span multiple geographic regions. Finally, I’ll describe our recent efforts to “meet customers where they are” by building features to ease migration of legacy applications to CockroachDB and reduce cost-to-serve.

**!Bio: Becca is a Senior Engineering Manager at Cockroach Labs.** During her 7+ years at the company, she helped build the cost-based query optimizer from scratch and added support for features such as geospatial indexing and locality-optimized search in multi-region clusters. Prior to joining Cockroach Labs, she was a graduate student at MIT, where she worked with Professor Michael Stonebraker researching distributed database elasticity and multi-tenancy.  Becca holds a B.S. in Physics from Yale University and an M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT. Outside of work, she enjoys rowing on the Chicago river and exploring the city with her husband and 18-month-old son.

**Abstract:** With all the cool data tech out there for data modeling, observability, analytics, quality, contracts, BI, etc, it can be very easy to fall in love with a particular data stack and a particular solution. But the best \*product\* teams out there will remind you that you’ll get a lot more done if you “fall in love with the problem” rather than any particular solution. For both product teams and data teams, a big part of that means understanding your users, and specifically for data teams, understanding the value users get from data and data products. What decisions are they making with data? What does data enable them to do? What business outcomes does it drive?

On the other hand, the work to do all this discovery about what data is valuable and why can be difficult and tedious. Stakeholders are notoriously busy and tend to be a lot better at asking for “I need XYZ chart” vs. “I need to solve ABC problem”. Most teams are already buried in ad-hoc requests and big migration projects – how can they \*also\* find the time to deeply get to know their users and fall in love with the right problems?

In this talk we’ll discuss the grounding and motivations for product thinking in data, how to get started in applying these principles to your data projects, share success stories from top-notch teams like GitLab, Netlify, ZoomInfo, and others, and explore some open source tools and techniques that can help.

!**Bio:** Dexter is cofounder and CEO at Metalytics, where he’s building tools to massively increase the business impact of data teams. His passion for data and data products comes from 7 years collaborating in a strong product-execution culture at Replicated across engineering, customer success, and product, helping B2B companies efficiently deliver their applications into the most secure enterprise datacenters. When he’s not hacking up the latest new ideas, Dex enjoys overcomplicated dinner prep and running the Chicago lakefront.

# Chicago Data Night: Douglas Laney (Infonomics)

Data is NOT the New Oil (Hint: It’s far more valuable)

February 21, 2024 4:00 PM – 7:00 PM

The Auditorium at 1871, Merchandise Mart

Please join us for our monthly **Chicago Data Night**, cohosted by [**ChiData**](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uchi-db.github.io/chidatasite/__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!44DGwsiDHf8kvRz3cTfhlGrL1A8_4hTd12bCShOhvxqarBKD3W8kNSK44h3Melid7ZdgFbRtrrVD4V4koCM$) and **[DSI](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/).** Practitioners, academics, and aficionados within the Chicago area are all invited to be part of a community at the intersection of industry and academia, brought together by a mutual interest in data.

**Abstract:** Increasingly, IT and business executives talk about information as one of their most important assets or “the new oil”. But few behave as if it is. Executives report to the board on the health of their workforce, their financials, their customers, and their partnerships, but rarely the health of their information assets. And corporations typically exhibit greater discipline in managing and accounting for their office furniture than their data.

In this session, Mr. Laney will share insights from his best-selling book, Infonomics, about how organizations can actually treat data as an actual enterprise asset. He will discuss why information both is and isn’t an asset and property, and what this means to organizations themselves and the investment community. And he will cover the issues of data ownership, rights, and privileges, along with alternative data challenges and opportunities, and his set of generally accepted information principles culled from other asset management disciplines.

This session will be beneficial for those looking to help their organization move beyond the trite “data is an asset” or “data is the new oil” lip-service to begin acting that way. Participants will learn and have an opportunity to discuss:

– How to monetize data assets in a wide variety of ways, including a number of real-world examples  
– How to manage data as an actual asset by applying asset management principles and practices from other asset domains  
– How to measure data’s potential and realized value to help budget for and prove data management benefits  
– How classic microeconomic concepts can be applied to data for improved data architecture & management, and economic benefits

**!Bio: Doug Laney,** ***Innovation Fellow, Data & Analytics Strategy.*** Doug is a best-selling author and recognized authority on data and analytics strategy.

Events as a Data Quanta: How Thinking with Events and DDD (Domain-Driven Design) will make you a Stronger Data User

November 13, 2024 5:30 PM – 7:30 PM

Drive Capital, 215 N Peoria Street

Please join us for our monthly **Chicago Data Night**, cohosted by **[Drive Capital](https://www.drivecapital.com/)**, **[ChiData](https://uchi-db.github.io/chidatasite/)**and the **[DSI](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/)**.

**Abstract:** In this talk, we’ll explore how thinking in Events and Domain-Driven Design can make you a stronger data producer and consumer. We’ll use [ezbot.ai](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://ezbot.ai__;!!BpyFHLRN4TMTrA!5Bl0moDaTUg7H88b4fHt9kFc5J1d0YjqoaibuIYrgFDKx90MRU21ZHaThSibPS35vMgDxhFegrXQCe6L4gU$)’s data pipeline as an example of this paradigm’s usefulness.

For most people, data means Rows and Columns in Tables. It means Entity-Relationship diagrams, SQL, and Joins. While this data modeling can be fantastically useful, it’s easy to “lose” lots of valuable information.

Rows frequently represent Entities. Entities may “change” over time; a User may move and change their Address. They may change their name or email. A Return may negate an Order. Without careful thought, these changes may cause an irrecoverable loss of information.

Enter Events: events are Facts about things that happened at a specific time. Events can describe changes to Entities, relationships, data points, and more. The State of an Entity can be reconstructed from the history of all of it’s relevant events. Treating Events as the Quanta of the data world can help ensure you never lose data and can always reconstruct information.

Using Events as a conceptual framework and Domain-Driven Design to explain how Entities and Events interact can help all data users better understand their domain.

**Abstract:**Data shapes our social, economic, cultural, and technological environments. Data is valuable, so people seek it, inducing data to flow. The resulting dataflows distribute data and thus value. For example, large Internet companies profit from accessing data from their users, and engineers of large language models seek large and diverse data sources to train powerful models. It is possible to judge the impact of data in an environment by analyzing how the dataflows in that environment impact the participating agents. My research hypothesizes that it is also possible to design (better) data environments by controlling what dataflows materialize; not only can we analyze environments but also synthesize them. In this talk, I present the research agenda on “data ecology,” which seeks to build the principles, theory, algorithms, and systems to design beneficial data environments. I will also present examples of data environments my group has designed, including data markets for machine learning, data-sharing, and data integration. I will conclude by discussing the impact of dataflows in data governance and how the ideas are interwoven with the concepts of trust, privacy, and the elusive notion of “data value.” As part of the technical discussion, I will complement the data market designs with the design of a data escrow system that permits controlling dataflows.

**!Raul Castro Fernandez: Assistant Professor, Computer Science, University of Chicago.**  In my research, I ask what is the value of data and explore the potential of data markets to unlock that value. My group collaborates with economists, legal scholars, statisticians, and domain scientists. We build systems to share, discover, prepare, integrate, and process data. I have traditionally worked on distributed query processing systems and continue to do so. I have received a SIGMOD’23 Test-of-time-Award. I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and on the Committee of Data Science at The University of Chicago. Before UChicago, I did a postdoc at MIT with Sam Madden and Mike Stonebraker. And before that, I completed a PhD at Imperial College London with Peter Pietzuch.

**Abstract:**  The primary role of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is to defend an organization against threats such as hacking and other types of electronic fraud/malfeasance. Due to a confluence of technological and human factors many organizations face a new set of cybersecurity threats that don’t neatly fit into a CISO’s current job description. Such threats include insider leaks, intellectual property theft, and AI manipulated inauthentic data — attacks that target or use privileged “knowledge” rather than device or data compromise. I will talk about the growing severity of knowledge-based attacks and the technical solutions developed in a new startup.

!**Bio:** **Sanjay Krishnan** is an Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago and Head of Research at EchoMark Inc. He has a number of publications, awards, patents, and serves on the organization committees of SIGMOD and VLDB. He received his PhD from UC Berkeley in 2018 and a BS/MS in 2012.

# Civic Data and Technology Clinic Showcase – Winter 2021

March 29, 2021 11:00 AM – 12:00 PM

Zoom

Data science, with the right mix of technical expertise and real-world experience, can be a powerful tool to address pressing social and environmental challenges. This winter, a partnership with the [11th Hour Project](http://www.11thhourproject.org/) continued support for the new **Civic Data and Technology Clinic** at the University of Chicago, a project-based course that paired teams of student data scientists with organizations working in social and economic justice, sustainability, and climate change. In this webinar, hear from students, faculty, and researchers about their work this quarter in collaboration with [Eureka Recycling](https://eurekarecycling.org/), [Inclusive Development International](https://www.inclusivedevelopment.net/), and [Hohonu](https://www.hohonu.io/). Lightning talks will feature projects including an application to track palm oil deforestation in South Eastern Asia, a system for monitoring recycling logistics and trends in the cities and towns surrounding Minneapolis, a data processing pipeline for aggregating water level data across the country, and a project to collate, index, and serve data on international development finance around the world.

The Civic Data and Technology Clinic and this event are supported by the [Harris School for Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/), the [Center for Data and Computing](/), and the [Master of Science in Computational Analysis & Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) program.

The Civic Data and Technology Clinic at the University of Chicago partners with public interest organizations, leveraging data science research and technology to address pressing social and environmental challenges. The Clinic also provides students with exposure to real-world projects and problems that transcend the conventional classroom experience including: 1) working with imperfect datasets, applying models and algorithms to real-world data, and navigating security and privacy issues; and 2) communicating results to a diverse set of stakeholders (e.g., industry, public interest, government agencies), and translating information into actionable insights, policy briefs and software prototypes. The Clinic is an experiential project-based course where students work in teams as data scientists with real-world clients under the supervision of instructors. Students will be tasked with producing key deliverables, such as data analysis, open source software, as well as final client presentations, and reports.

**Abstract:** Generative molecular design seeks to propose novel molecular structures that may surpass what is available in enumerated virtual libraries. While enumerated libraries are large, the enormity of chemical spaces means that there are ample opportunities for “creativity” in molecular design. In this talk, I will describe two recent projects that advance our ability to design molecular structures. First, I will introduce a 3D molecular generative model that facilitates interaction-aware chemical design by learning the joint distribution over 3D molecular structures and their shapes, electrostatics, and pharmacophores. Empirically, this model can sample chemically diverse molecules with highly enriched interaction-similarity to target structures, design small-molecule mimics of complex natural products, diversify bioactive hits while enriching docking scores despite having no knowledge of the protein, and merge fragments from experimental fragment screens into bioisosteric ligands. Second, I will describe a generative framework that mitigates lack of synthesizable as a major failure mode of molecular design. Our model ensures that every generated molecule has a viable synthetic pathway, enabling the design of analogs and optimization of molecular properties while maintaining synthetic feasibility. By providing effective and controllable navigation within synthesizable chemical space, we can provide actionable suggestions of new small organic molecules across a range of fields, including drug development and materials science.

# Consumer Spending During Unemployment with Peter Ganong (UChicago)

Using data from hundreds of thousands of bank accounts, Peter Ganong of the Harris School of Public Policy studied how unemployment benefits affect spending, with implications for both economic theory and policy.

May 8, 2019 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM

## Event Recap

Social scientists are always on the lookout for “natural experiments” — situations where policy differences unintentionally create distinct populations that can be compared to test theories and scientific questions. For example, a researcher studying the effects of minimum wage increases can compare two demographically similar cities or states, where one raised wages and the other did not. While less precise than a controlled experiment, these comparisons can provide large amounts of data for testing different hypotheses, while minimizing the ethical concerns of only offering benefits to half of a subject pool.

Data science and new policies for the use of proprietary data in research have unlocked new opportunities for finding and utilizing these natural experiments. In his May 8th talk for the inaugural Center for Data and Computing Speaker Series, [Peter Ganong](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/peter-ganong) of the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy discussed one such example, using financial data from JPMorganChase Bank. With his co-author Pascal Noel, Ganong used data from hundreds of thousands of bank accounts to [study how unemployment benefits affect spending](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/1/801/files/2018/12/ganong_noel_ui-2mdz1nn.pdf), with implications for both economic theory and how unemployment benefits are structured.

!

In the talk below, Ganong walks through the process of obtaining the data, converting it to best answer their research question, the results of their analysis, and how their conclusions could be used to better design unemployment policy. The study looked at 20 different states, where policies can vary by the amount paid through unemployment insurance and the duration of those benefits. The researchers could then look not only at the overall effect of unemployment policy on spending by households after job loss, but compare states with different benefit structures.

The primary result — that household spending drops both when unemployment begins and when benefits end — may sound logical to many, but settles one aspect of an economic dispute between rational and behavioral models. Zooming in to look at states with more generous or longer benefits allowed Ganong and Noel to conclude that the gains from making benefits longer than current length was larger than raising the level of UI benefits.

“This is evidence of just how strongly month-by-month spending is responding to income coming out of unemployment benefits,” Ganong said.

As part of [the first cohort of CDAC Data Science Discovery projects](/2019/04/10/cdac-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-data-science-discovery-projects/), Ganong and Noel will continue to explore this data and phenomena, focusing on how financial resilience interacts with racial inequality. Using the same Chase dataset, the researchers will measure income and spending on a day-to-day basis to examine how households cope with economic shocks, measuring financial resilience by whether household members cut back on grocery spending, skip doctors appointments, or miss bill payments. For a topic at the sensitive intersection of welfare policy, race, and economics, data science enables new, powerful natural experiments for important research questions that would be otherwise impractical or impossible.

CDAC Data Dispatches

# Deciphering Cuneiform with Artificial Intelligence

Part of the CDAC Data Dispatches Spring Series, remote gatherings that feature ongoing CDAC-funded research and collaborations across units and fields.

April 3, 2020 12:30 PM – 1:30 PM

Zoom

**NOTE: These events will be held remotely, via [Zoom](http://bit.ly/datadispatches). Please [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/deciphering-cuneiform-with-artificial-intelligence-tickets-99224608475) to receive a link on the day of the talk.**

Manually deciphering a cuneiform tablet is a laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone process. This project explores how recent advances in computer vision can assist researchers by automatically identifying symbols and words in images of cuneiform tablets. It will leverage the extensively annotated collections of the Online Cultural and Historical Research Environment (OCHRE) as training data for machine learning vision models that preliminary results suggest are accurate up to 83 percent of the time. The project is an important step towards the goal of meaningful automatic transcription and indexing of the extensive worldwide cuneiform tablet collection.

[Read more on the project in this feature.](/news/ancient-language-processing-teaching-computers-to-read-cuneiform-tablets/)

**CDAC Data Dispatches Spring Series**

During the spring quarter, the Center for Data and Computing will host a series of remote gatherings that feature ongoing CDAC-funded research and collaborations across units and fields. Each date will feature a CDAC project sharing brief presentations about their work, followed by open discussion between the researchers and the audience.

We encourage all CDAC research funding recipients to attend, and also invite faculty, students, and campus researchers interested in data science, machine learning, and other applied computational tools. Events will take place via Zoom software. Please RSVP if you plan to attend, and we will send updated links and reminders before the talk.

# Dimitris Giannakis (Dartmouth): CAM and DSI Joint Colloquium

Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators

April 25, 2025 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM

Jones 303

Please join us for CAM and DSI joint colloquium.

**Friday, April 25**  
**12:00pm – 1:00pm**  
**Jones 303**  
**5747 S. Ellis Avenue**

**Abstract:** A key structural property of Koopman (composition) operators of dynamical systems is that they are multiplicative on spaces of observables with a product structure. This property implies, for instance, that the point spectrum is an abelian group and that the corresponding eigenfunctions also form a group under pointwise function multiplication. Computational approximation techniques for Koopman operators typically do not preserve multiplicativity in a strict sense, yet one might expect that for approximations that are sufficiently “close” to the original operator products of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions should be useful for building models for the evolution of observables. Using this as a working hypothesis, in this talk we present a scheme for approximating the Koopman evolution of observables that is based on a lift to a Fock space where regularized Koopman operators are multiplicative with respect to the tensor product. This Fock space is generated by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of observables endowed with the structure of a coalgebra with respect to the tensor product, and the structure of a Banach algebra with respect to the pointwise product of functions. The resulting approximation scheme can be cast in the form of a tree tensor network allowing for efficient computation in high-dimensional spaces generated multiplicatively from a modest collection of approximate Koopman eigenfunctions. We illustrate this approach with applications to measure-preserving ergodic flows on tori.

**!Bio:** My primary research areas are operator methods for dynamical systems and mathematical data science. I joined Dartmouth College in September 2021 as Jack Byrne Professor in Mathematics. Previously, I was an Associate Professor of Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. As of July 2024, I am serving as Chair of Dartmouth’s Department of Mathematics.

# Gari Clifford (Emory) – Mythological Medical Machine Learning: Boosting the performance of a deep learning medical data classifier using realistic medical models

December 6, 2021 3:00 PM – 4:00 PM

John Crerar Library Building

*This event will take place both in-person at John Crerar Library Building Room 390 and online via Zoom or YouTube.*

**Abstract**: There is a myth in modern machine learning, that as the size of a database increases, and the network depth increases, the performance of an algorithm will continue to improve. This myth is particularly untrue for medical data, which require intense curation to create high-quality labels. As the databases increase in size, the data labels drop in quality or even vanish. Often, the data become noisier with rising levels of non-random missingness. Increasingly, transfer learning is being leveraged to mitigate these problems, allowing algorithms to tune on smaller (or rarer) populations while leveraging information from much larger datasets. I’ll present an emerging paradigm in which we insert an extensive model-generated database in the transfer learning process to help a deep learner explore a much larger and denser data distribution. Since a model allows the generation of realistic data beyond the boundaries of the real data, the model can help train the deep learner to extrapolate beyond the observable collection of samples. Using cardiac time series data, I’ll demonstrate that this technique provides a significant performance boost. I’ll then discuss how general this approach is, and how it can distinguish AI from machine learning.

**Bio**: Gari Clifford is a tenured Professor of Biomedical Informatics and Biomedical Engineering at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Emory. His research team applies signal processing and machine learning to medicine to classify, track and predict health and illness. His focus research areas include critical care, digital psychiatry, global health, mHealth, neuroinformatics and perinatal health, particularly in LMIC settings.  After training in Theoretical Physics, he transitioned to Machine Learning and Engineering for his doctoral work at the University of Oxford in the 1990’s. He subsequently joined MIT as a postdoctoral fellow, then a Principal Research Scientist, where he managed the creation of the MIMIC II database, the largest open-access critical care database in the world.

Earth’s climate is chaotic and noisy. Finding usable signals amidst all of the noise can be challenging: be it predicting ifit will rain, knowing which direction a hurricane will go, understanding the implications of melting Arctic ice, or detecting the impacts of human-induced climate warming. Here, I will demonstrate how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques can sift through vast amounts of climate data and push the bounds of scientific discovery: allowing scientists to ask “why?” but now with the power of machine learning.

**Bio**: [Dr. Elizabeth (Libby) Barnes](http://barnes.atmos.colostate.edu/) is a Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. She joined the CSU faculty in 2013 after obtaining dual B.S. degrees (Honors) in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Minnesota, obtaining her Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science from the University of Washington, and spending a year as a NOAA Climate & Global Change Fellow at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Professor Barnes’ research is largely focused on climate variability, predictability, and change and the data analysis tools used to understand it. 

Dr. Barnes’ current research topics of interest include earth system predictability, subseasonal-to-decadal (S2D) prediction, climate intervention research, and data science methods for earth system research (e.g. machine learning, causal discovery). She teaches graduate courses on fundamental atmospheric dynamics and data science and statistical analysis methods. Professor Barnes is involved in a number of research community activities. In addition to being a member of the National Academies’s Committee on Earth Science and Applications from Space, on the National Academies’ Board on Atmospheric Science and Climate, a funded member of the NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES), and on the Steering Committee of the CSU Data Science Research Institute, she recently finished being the lead of the NOAA MAPP S2S Prediction Task Force (2016-2020).

Dr. Barnes received the AGU Macelwane Medal and became a Fellow of the AGU in 2021, received the AGU Turco Lectureship for 2020, AMS Clarence Leroy Meisinger Award for 2020, and was awarded an NSF CAREER grant in 2018. She received the George T. Abell Outstanding Early-Career Faculty Award in 2016 and was recognized for her teaching and mentoring by being awarded an Honorable Mention for the CSU Graduate Advising and Mentorship Award in 2017 and being named the Outstanding Professor of the Year Award in 2016 and 2022 by the graduate students of the Department of Atmospheric Science. In 2014 she was the recipient of an AGU James R. Holton Junior Scientist Award.

# Esteban Real (Google DeepMind): Automatically Discovering Learning Algorithms with Hardware Constraints

Esteban Real, Research Scientist at Google DeepMind

November 4, 2024 3:00 PM – 4:00 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 298

**Abstract:**

Can learning emerge from a search process in-silico? Our AutoML-Zero work at Google DeepMind shows that a simple evolutionary search process can automatically discover modern learning techniques from scratch. Without knowledge of machine learning, the method discovers algorithms by combining simple primitives such as additions and multiplications into a functional learning algorithm. In this type of evolutionary search, learning emerges naturally when algorithm survival depends on its performance on multiple tasks. These discovery methods transfer to realistic setups, where we can find novel algorithms for ML optimization and robot adaptation. Importantly, we can meaningfully shape the properties of the discovered algorithm by constraining the environment on which the algorithm evolves. I will speculate that using hardware abstractions as such a constraint is a promising direction for finding new paradigms of neural computation.

**Speaker Bio:**

Esteban Real is a Research Scientist at Google Deep Mind. Real previously worked at the Google Brain Team within Google Research. Esteban Real focuses on bio-inspired computing, especially automated machine learning (AutoML), the combination of evolutionary computation and learning, and the relationship between natural and artificial neural networks. A selection of Real’s publications can be found in Esteban Real’s [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ipTsozQAAAAJ).

Understanding the impact of climate change on the diversity of global marine species has important economic value for fishery and policy making. Changes in water temperature, nutrients, and ecological associations can affect an organism’s physical form and growth, which are critical to determining where a species can survive. Using modern 3D imaging technology, this project will quantify large-scale variations in bivalve shell morphology and statistically analyze how they respond to global climate change by developing highly efficient end-to-end geometric deep learning systems that can automatically extract latent semantic representations from millions of micro-CT scans.

**Abstract:** Genetic association studies have identified many disease causing genes, providing valuable insights into potential cures. However, the complex, multifactorial, and polygenic nature of most common diseases presents a significant challenge to further progress. While hundreds of thousands of genomic loci have been linked to various diseases, the mechanisms through which they contribute to disease remain largely unknown. Several predictive methods have been developed to explain the downstream effects of genetic variation. However, the high costs and limited sample sizes often hinder the generation of sufficient data for these methods to be fully effective. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the current state of complex disease genetics, describe traditional population-based approaches, and show how the integration of large-scale deep learning models, capable of learning the grammar of DNA, can significantly enhance our ability to address challenging problems. I will present examples involving single-cell RNA sequencing data and transcription factor binding, demonstrating how these models can expand the number of predictable features by several orders of magnitude, thereby advancing our understanding of disease biology.

# Krzysztof Gajos

Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science, Harvard University

I am a Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I lead the Intelligent Interactive Systems Group at Harvard. Currently, my group has the following focus areas:

- Principles and applications of intelligent interactive systems. How do we build AI-powered systems such that they are well suited for the strengths and limitations of human cognition, perception and behavior?

- Behavioral research at scale. We are building platforms (e.g., Lab in the Wild and Hevelius) that allow us to conduct behavioral research with tens of thousands of participants. We are interested both in developing new tools and methods, and in doing novel science that such tools enable.

- Design for equity and social justice. Design impacts human behavior (seriously). Some of our design practices may inadvertently exacerbate inequalities. Thoughtful design can also improve support more equitable and more socially just outcomes. This interest originates from our work on accessible computing, but has expanded to include implicit bias, equitable access to healthcare, and more.

In the past, I made contributions in the following areas (which are still of some interest, just not the main focus of my current work): accessible computing, adaptive user interfaces, creativity support, crowd computing.

# Daniel Oppenheimer

Professor, Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University

There is an awful lot of information in the world. Some of it is useful; most of it is not. How do people determine what information to use when making decisions, what is worth learning, how to search for the information they need, and what do people do when different pieces of information conflict and suggest different conclusions? Professor Oppenheimer’s research investigates these basic questions as well as how the answers impact real world outcomes in policy, business, and education.

He has also done research on psychometric assessment, charitable giving, people’s understanding of randomness/stochastic systems, the psychological underpinnings of democracy, helicopter parenting, metacognition, and the best local ice cream stores.

# Inderjit S. Dhillon (The University of Texas at Austin) – MatFormer: Nested Transformer for Elastic Inference

April 5, 2024 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM

Jones 303

*Part of the [Spring 2024 Distinguished Speaker Series](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/spring-2024-distinguished-speaker-series) and the [CAM Colloquium](https://cam.uchicago.edu/events/cam-colloquium/).*

Large Language Models are powered by the underlying transformer deep learning architecture. These models are deployed in a wide range of settings, from multiaccelerator clusters to standalone mobile phones. The diverse memory and computational constraints in these scenarios necessitate practitioners to train models of various sizes to cater to each constraint. Training each of these models is computationally expensive, while also requiring maintaining each of them separately. Moreover, this limits more fine-grained control over relevant tradeoffs, including latency, cost, and accuracy. In this talk, I will introduce our recent work in this direction, “MatFormer”, which stands for “Matroyshka” Transformers. This transformer architecture encapsulates information in a nested manner, facilitating the extraction of subnetworks tailored to specific constraints. I will discuss the training methodology, the advantages over existing methods, and results across different model classes (decoders & encoders), modalities (language & vision), and scales (up to 2.6 billion parameters). Finally, I will outline our future directions to enhance efficiency and scalability for the training and deployment of such large models.

**Bio**: [Inderjit Dhillon](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/) is the Gottesman Family Centennial Professor of Computer Science and Mathematics at UT Austin, where he is also the Director of the ICES Center for Big Data Analytics.

[Campus Visitor Information & COVID Policy](https://goforward.uchicago.edu/visitor-information/)

**Motivation:** As of 2018, 24 million Americans have no broadband Internet access. In the face of modern natural disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Internet is showing its cracks not in the protocols or infrastructure, but in the lack of equitable access across America’s diverse places and populations. As the cornerstones of our nation move online—from education to healthcare to agriculture and innovation— the well-known “digital divide” is becoming more consequential as a vector of inequality. This divide becomes even more pronounced in times of natural disaster, when citizens may rely almost exclusively on Internet communications for many critical aspects of daily life. 

To better understand these challenges, critical research and innovation is required to ensure broadband connectivity for unserved and underserved American communities. The workshop will explore connectivity by addressing the following themes: 

* **Theme One – Education:** 12 million children face the so-called “homework gap”—barriers to completing schoolwork without reliable home Internet access. This barrier disproportionately hurts low-income families and minorities, for example in Chicago, approximately 1 in 5 primarily Black or Latinx children lack access to broadband. With the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affecting many low-income and minority groups, the families and communities who were already the most vulnerable may now face even more challenges during a long-term economic recession.
* **Theme Two –  Agriculture:** Farms could contribute billions more dollars to the U.S. economy with the help of precision agriculture technology, but this can’t happen without connectivity and reliable last-mile Broadband solutions. Recent reports have indicated that almost two-thirds of farmers don’t have adequate Internet connectivity to run their businesses and innovate.
* **Theme Three – Healthcare:**  As healthcare increasingly moves into the digital age, there is a significant proportion of the most vulnerable Americans that lack access to telehealth. For example, Medicaid and Medicare recipients make up two-thirds of those without access to the internet at home. How do we ensure that advances in telemedicine and remote care serve the most vulnerable populations?

*This convening is open to all invitees who are compliant with UChicago vaccination requirements and, because of ongoing health risks, particularly to the unvaccinated, participants are expected to adopt the risk mitigation measures (masking and social distancing, etc.) appropriate to their vaccination status as advised by public health officials or to their individual vulnerabilities as advised by a medical professional. Public convening may not be safe for all and carries a risk for contracting COVID-19, particularly for those unvaccinated. Participants will not know the vaccination status of others and should follow appropriate risk mitigation measures.”*

# Introducing PalmWatch: Mapping the impact of big brands’ palm oil use

February 22, 2024 7:00 AM – 8:30 AM

Zoom Virtual Conference

!

Inclusive Development International and the Data Science Institute at the University of Chicago are launching PalmWatch, a new open-access tool that uses advanced data science and open-source intelligence techniques to create a uniquely comprehensive and detailed picture of global palm oil supply chains.

PalmWatch uses novel methods to scrape the web for the most up-to-date information on which palm oil mills major brands source from, and to more precisely identify the cultivation areas supplying those individual mills. The tool allows users to link the biggest users of palm oil, such as Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever, to the ground-level impacts of their palm oil consumption, including hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of deforestation.

Speakers will include: — Dustin Roasa, Research Director at Inclusive Development International (IDI) — David Uminsky, Executive Director of the Data Science Institute at the University of Chicago (DSI) — Syahrul Fitra, Senior Forest Campaigner at Greenpeace Southeast Asia (Greenpeace SEA) NOTE: The event will be held in English with simultaneous interpretation into Bahasa Indonesia.

**Abstract:** UniverseTBD is an interdisciplinary community of astronomers, AI researchers, engineers, artists and enthusiasts aligned on a bold mission to democratise Science for everyone. From releasing the first large language model in Astronomy, AstroLLaMA-1, to the AI-enabled literature discovery tool Pathfinder, and through our research with AstroPT and HypoGen, our team has pushed the boundaries of AI for Science for the past two years. In this talk, I discuss how UniverseTBD came to be, our vision, our values, and what drives us and has enabled us to scale our team projects in our commitment to sharing our learnings with the broader scientific community. I also discuss our latest results from hypothesis generation (HypoGen) to multimodal language models (AstroLlaVA-1) and agentic AI (AstroCoder). I conclude with a vision for the future where AI teams up with human researchers to “help us understand the Universe”.

**!Bio: Ioana Ciucă:** I am an interdisciplinary researcher in Astrophysics and Computer Science at Stanford University, where I coordinate the Frontier AI Pillar of the Center for Decoding the Universe. My daily work involves developing AI models that advance our understanding of the Universe and push the boundaries of scientific research. As the co-founder of UniverseTBD, together with Kartheik Iyer (Columbia), I’m driven by the belief that scientific knowledge should be accessible to all. Our team democratises science by releasing AI tools and openly sharing our learnings and research as we explore this new technology for Science.

# Irina Rish (Université de Montréal) – Scaling to AGI

April 18, 2024 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 390

*Part of the [Spring 2024 Distinguished Speaker Series](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/spring-2024-distinguished-speaker-series).*

!

The field of AI is advancing at unprecedented speed due to the rise of foundation models – large-scale, self-supervised pre-trained models whose impressive capabilities greatly increase with scaling the data, models and compute. Empirical *neural scaling laws* aim to predict scaling behaviors of foundation models, thus serving as an “investment tool” towards choosing the best-scaling methods with increased compute, likely to stand the test of time and  escaping “the bitter lesson”. Moreover, predicting AI behaviors at scale, especially “phase transitions” and emergence,  is highly important  from the perspective of AI Safety and Alignment with human intent. I will present our efforts towards accurate forecasting of AI behaviors using both an open-box approach, when model’s internal learning dynamics is accessible, and a closed-box approach of inferring neural scaling laws based solely on external observations of AI behavior at scale.

Finally, this talk will provide an overview of open-source foundation models our lab has built and released so far using large-scale INCITE allocation on Summit and Frontier supercomputers, including several 9.6B LLMs trained continually, the first Hindi model Hi-NOLIN,  multimodal vision-text model suite Robin, as well as time-series foundation models. I will highlight the continual pre training paradigm that allows to train models on potentially infinite datasets, as well as approaches to AI ethics and multimodal alignment. See our CERC-AAI project page for more details: **https://www.irina-lab.ai/projects.**

# Jake Hoffman: An illusion of predictability in scientific results

SENIOR PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER (& FOUNDING MEMBER)
MICROSOFT RESEARCH, NEW YORK CITY

May 16, 2024 9:30 AM – 11:00 AM

Room 295

**THE COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE WORKSHOP PRESENTS**

**JAKE HOFFMAN**

**SENIOR PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER (& FOUNDING MEMBER)**

**MICROSOFT RESEARCH, NEW YORK CITY**

**Abstract:**  In many fields there has been a long-standing emphasis on inference (obtaining unbiased estimates of individual effects) over prediction (forecasting future outcomes), perhaps because the latter can be quite difficult, especially when compared with the former. Here we show that this focus on inference over prediction can mislead readers into thinking that the results of scientific studies are more definitive than they actually are. Through a series of randomized experiments, we demonstrate that this confusion arises for one of the most basic ways of presenting statistical findings and affects even experts whose jobs involve producing and interpreting such results. In contrast, we show that communicating both inferential and predictive information side by side provides a simple and effective alternative, leading to calibrated interpretations of scientific results. We conclude with a more general discussion about integrative modeling, where prediction and inference are combined to complement, rather than compete with, each other.

**Attendance**: The presentation will be held in Room 295, 1155 E. 60th Street, with overflow and remote participants on [Zoom](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/uchicago.zoom.us/j/96522960423?pwd=cEYvcXJXcUJVZW1hdjFkZ1MxNEQ1Zz09__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!QH5mRL7id_moeS9U53B0i0tKoZ4f0x40eqogPR3qyDQVs6UuUze7QIqHqlpCU5EyVSxFIRNG1_km3sUM2cnM1o0J1w$ "https://uchicago.zoom.us/j/96522960423?pwd=cEYvcXJXcUJVZW1hdjFkZ1MxNEQ1Zz09") at this address.

*Part of the [Autumn 2022 Distinguished Speaker Series](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/autumn-2022-distinguished-speaker-series/).*

Clinical trials are the gatekeeper and bottleneck of medicine. In the first half of the talk, I discuss lessons learned from our systematic analysis of all the FDA-approved medical AI devices, which reveals key limitations in how AIs are evaluated (Wu et al. Nature Medicine 2021). Motivated by this, I share the design and results from our recent randomized prospective clinical trial evaluating EchoNet, a computer vision AI for assessing cardiac conditions. In the second half, I will discuss how to use AI (Trial Pathfinder) to make clinical trials more diverse and efficient (Liu et al. Nature 2021). Trial Pathfinder is used by pharma companies to guide new trials and was selected as a Top Ten Clinical Research Achievement.

**Earth System Modeling for Actionable Science**

The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Science initiated the development of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) in 2014. The project was motivated by the need for an Earth system model to support DOE’s energy mission and meet the requirement to run on the next-generation Exascale computing systems. To provide actionable information on the climate impacts on energy and water sectors and how climate change may influence sustainable energy futures, we developed a three-pronged strategy focusing on high-resolution modeling to improve simulations of extreme events that impact energy production and use, modeling the coupled human-Earth system to project future outcomes, and large ensemble modeling to quantify uncertainty. In this lecture, I will briefly introduce E3SM, including the recently released E3SM version 3 and the global cloud-resolving model (SCREAM) that achieves a throughput of over one simulated year per day on the Frontier exascale computer. With an emphasis on modeling extreme events and their future changes, we further leverage AI/ML to reduce model biases in simulating the large-scale circulations associated with extreme events, improve model calibration and uncertainty quantification, and address the challenges in modeling hurricane risk and wildfires.

**Abstract:** Our immune systems are complex and dynamic systems that respond to threats – both internal and external – to keep us healthy. However, studying human immunity is a non-trivial task. Until recently, researchers had to trade spatial information for phenotypic resolution. Advances in immunofluorescence (IF) staining chemistry have facilitated highly multiplexed imaging of human tissue, allowing us to probe more than 10x the number of cell phenotypes than standard multiplex fluorescence microscopy. With over 60 unique proteins probed in situ, we can view the immune states in human tissue samples with astonishing detail. While powerful, these rich image data can be difficult to quantify, and therefore difficult to extract biological meaning from. In this talk, I will discuss approaches for detecting and characterizing cells in these high-plex images, and how quantifying these rich images can help us to better understand the spatial organization of dysfunctional immune states.

**!Bio:** Madeleine Torcasso is a biomedical engineer and imaging scientist specializing in quantitative image analysis of biomedical microscopy images. Madeleine received her PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Texas A&amp;M University, focusing on radiative transport modeling to optimize bio-optical imaging and sensing systems. She joined the University of Chicago in 2018, working under the guidance of Dr. Maryellen Giger in the Department of Radiology on several biomedical image analysis projects. Madeleine is currently an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago. Her research focuses on applying AI to microscopy images to learn more about the spatial distribution of cells, particularly immune cells, in pathological conditions.

# Margo Seltzer (University of British Columbia): Distinguished Speaker Series

The Science and Meta-Science of Data Science

April 11, 2025 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 390

*Part of the [2025 Distinguished Speaker Series.](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/2024-25-distinguished-speaker-series/)*

!

The University of Chicago Data Science Institute, Department of Statistics, Department of Computer Science, and Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics are proud to announce our 2025 Distinguished Speaker Series. Join us for stimulating talks from leading data science researchers exploring and expanding the fundamental methods and approaches that transform large and complex datasets into knowledge and action.

Events will take place in the John Crerar Library Building, Room 390, with a lunch social starting at noon before the lecture at 12:30 p.m (unless otherwise noted).

**Abstract:** Data Science has emerged as a new discipline that unites data, statistics, and the mathematical and computational methods that allow us to derive insights from data. In a previous era, we might have described this field as the the new, computational methodological pillar of research, complementing the theoretical and empirical pillars. Although computing had been fundamental to many fields of scientific research since the advent of computers, this new pillar recognized the impact that computation offered unprecedented scalability in both data and compute. The emergence of data science recognizes that the methodology that underlies this computational pillar is its own field of inquiry.

However, the data scientist is faced with scientific challenges on two levels. First, there are the fundamental domain-specific questions one is trying to answer using this data-centric methodology. The research practices for addressing such questions are well-understood but do not easily translate into practice. Second, the practice of data science introduces new methodological questions concerning the authenticity and veracity of data and the reproducibility of computational experiments. I call these the challenges of meta-science. These meta-scientific challenges appear similar to software engineering. However tools developed for software engineering treat computational artifacts as primary output; in data science, computational artifacts are not primary output, they are the tools used to produce primary output. This mismatch in purpose leads to a dearth of solutions to the meta-scientific questions.

In this talk, I’ll discuss the myriad ways that we have failed to produce the right tools to support data scientists. I’ll contrast the process and goals of software engineering and data science, how they differ, and why these differences have led to the reproducibility crisis. Finally, I’ll present a few examples of a way forward, including tools that meet data scientists where they work, make reproducibility easier, and provide a vision of how we improve upon the meta-scientific practices in data science.

**Abstract:** In the development of materials for realistic applications, the detection and understanding of atomic and electronic structures, especially of defects, interfaces, and nanostructures, is paramount. Advances characterization via electron, x-ray, and atom probes, in imaging, scattering, and spectroscopic modes, have brought us closer to such detection and understanding. However, such experimental data is often difficult to parse and relate to fundamental understanding of mechanisms and behavior at the atomic level. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts in MaterialEyes to use AI/ML and theoretical modeling to enable the seeing of atomic structures from experimental characterization data. I will also discuss our work in using AI to extract and use microscopy and spectroscopy data from scientific literature.

Many behaviors empirically observed in deep neural networks still lack satisfactory explanation; e.g., how does an overparameterized neural network avoid overfitting and generalize to unseen data?  Empirical evidence suggests that generalization depends on *which* zero-loss local minimum is attained during training. The shape of the training loss around a local minimum seems to strongly impact the model’s performance: “Flat” local minima—around which the loss grows slowly—appear to generalize well. Clarifying this phenomenon can help explain generalization properties, which still largely remain a mystery.

Towards this goal, in this talk we focus on the simplest class of overparameterized nonlinear models, those arising in low-rank matrix recovery. We study the following key models: overparametrized matrix sensing, bilinear sensing and phase retrieval, robust Principal Component Analysis, covariance matrix estimation, and single hidden layer neural networks with quadratic activation. We prove that in all these models, flat minima (measured by the trace of the Hessian, a notion of average curvature) exactly recover the ground truth, under standard statistical assumptions. These results suggest (i) a theoretical basis for favoring methods that bias iterates towards flat solutions, (ii) use of Hessian trace as a good regularizer for some learning tasks. Since the landscape properties we proved are algorithm-agnostic, a future direction is to pair these findings with the analysis of common training algorithms to understand the interplay between the loss landscape and algorithmic implicit bias.

*Part of the 2024-25 [Distinguished Speaker Series](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/2024-25-distinguished-speaker-series/).*

!

AI has undergone a dramatic paradigm shift, not only in terms of the impressive capabilities of state-of-the-art models, but also in terms of how they are trained, deployed, and evaluated. Most importantly, AI systems do not exist in a controlled environment anymore (e.g., meticulously collected i.i.d. samples), but interact continuously with social systems, e.g., through training and evaluation data as well as their direct influence on social processes. Crucially, the validity of even our most basic machine learning methods is not guaranteed in this new context. Yet, without valid methodology we cannot ensure the intended outcomes of deployed AI systems nor continue to advance AI research in a scientifically sound way.

In this talk, I will therefore argue that we need new theoretical foundations for machine learning and AI that explicitly account for the complex social system with which an AI system interacts or in which it is situated. I will discuss this on the example of the ubiquitous train-test paradigm. While this form of model validation has arguably been one of the single most important contributors to the breathtaking progress in AI, I will show via rigorous impossibility results that it is not valid anymore for key tasks in modern AI under current data collection practices. Based on these insights, I will also introduce a novel cooperative approach to data collection with strong game-theoretical guarantees that can alleviate these issues. I will conclude this talk with a call for increased interdisciplinary work at the intersection of AI theory, methods, and society.

Bio: Max Nickel is a research scientist manager at FAIR, Meta AI where he is leading the AI & Society team and also acted as a research area lead for Machine Learning and Society & Responsible AI. Before joining FAIR, Max was as a postdoctoral fellow at MIT where he was with the Laboratory for Computational and Statistical Learning and the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines. He received his PhD with summa cum laude from the Ludwig Maximilian University Munich as a research assistant at Siemens Corporate Technology. Recently, Max has also acted as Program Chair for ICLR 2023.

Max’s research is focused on understanding the interplay of AI and social systems. For this purpose, he is combining machine learning theory and methods with complex systems theory including networks, dynamics, and emergence. Max aimsto establish the necessary theoretical and methodological foundations for AI to safely interact with society and to obtain results that have a direct impact on AI practice, methods, and governance.

**Abstract:**  ML methods for cosmology often hinge on one essential assumption: that the simulations sufficiently capture reality. But is this necessarily the case? Observations may be out of the domain of the simulations, with the data sets differing in subtle but important ways. These differences can be very difficult to detect and quantify, but they *must* be detected and quantified, or risk biasing the results. This is especially important in the scenario where one wants to train deep learning methods on simulations and then directly apply the models to observations as a black box. In this talk, I will highlight opportunities and challenges for creating credible ML to interpret galaxy cluster observations. I will expand on ML interpretability and domain adaptation as keystones for building models that give trustworthy results. And I will show examples of how machine learning can be used, not just as a tool for getting “better” results at the expense of understanding but also as a partner that can point us toward physical discovery.

She joined STScI after a first career in education, and has a decade of classroom teaching experience. She has run multiple teacher-training programs in Africa, teaching Rwandese high school educators how to use inexpensive, commonly available items as lecture demonstrations to enhance student learning.  At her career transition from education to astronomy, Dr. Ntampaka received an American Physical Society Blewett Fellowship, a national award for women returning to careers in physics.  After completing her Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, she was a member of the inaugural cohort of Harvard Data Science Fellows. Dr. Ntampaka’s research focuses on ways to use machine learning as a tool for cosmological discovery.  While the field has traditionally used machine learning techniques as a black box, Dr. Ntampaka’s work explores how to build trustworthy and interpretable ML methods as a partner for interpreting cosmological large-scale structure.

# Microbial ‘Omics for Beginners

Zoom

The primary aim of this seminar series is to give a broad introduction to some of the key concepts and strategies that enable us to study the ecology, evolution, and functioning of naturally occurring microbial populations.

The last several years witnessed tremendous advances in molecular and computational approaches which now offer unprecedented access to naturally occurring microbial communities through new ‘omics strategies. Developing an overall understanding of these strategies -including the ability to identify their appropriate applications and shortcomings- has quietly become a de facto necessity in the journey of an independent life scientist.

While most of these strategies are quite accessible thanks to the increasing number of computational tools and pipelines, without a complete understanding of the key concepts, exploiting available computational solutions to address unique scientific questions remain difficult. The purpose of the seminar series is to offer some introductions to key concepts, without talking about tools or their practical applications.

[Image: A headshot of Milind Tambe is accompanied by text describing the Distinguished Speaker Series event: it takes place at 12:30pm in John Crerar Library Room 390.]

For more than 15 years, my team and I have been focused on AI for social impact, deploying end-to-end systems in areas of public health, conservation and public safety. In this talk, I will highlight the results from our deployments for social impact in public health and conservation, as well as required innovations in integrating machine learning and optimization. First in terms of public health, I will present recent results from our work in India with the world’s two largest mobile health programs for maternal and child care that have served millions of beneficiaries. Additionally, I will highlight results from earlier projects on HIV prevention and others. In terms of conservation, I will highlight efforts for protecting endangered wildlife in national parks around the globe.  To address challenges of ML+optimizaton  common to all of these applications, we have advanced the state of the art in decision focused learning, restless multi-armed bandits, influence maximization in social networks and green security games. In pushing this research agenda, our ultimate goal is to facilitate local communities and non-profits to directly benefit from advances in AI tools and techniques.

# Moshe Vardi (Rice University): Distinguished Speaker Series

Efficiency, Resilience, and Artificial Intelligence

May 16, 2025 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 390

*Part of the [2025 Distinguished Speaker Series.](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/2024-25-distinguished-speaker-series/)*

!

The University of Chicago Data Science Institute, Department of Statistics, Department of Computer Science, and Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics are proud to announce our 2025 Distinguished Speaker Series. Join us for stimulating talks from leading data science researchers exploring and expanding the fundamental methods and approaches that transform large and complex datasets into knowledge and action.

Events will take place in the John Crerar Library Building, Room 390, with a lunch social starting at noon before the lecture at 12:30 p.m (unless otherwise noted).

**Abstract:** In both computer science and economics, efficiency is a cherished property. The field of algorithms is almost solely focused on their efficiency. The goal of AI research is to increase efficiency by reducing human labor.  In economics, the main advantage of the free market is that it promises “economic efficiency”. A major lesson from many recent disasters is that these fields have over-emphasized efficiency and under-emphasized resilience. I argue that resilience is a more important property than efficiency and discuss how the two fields can broaden their  
focus to make resilience a primary consideration.  I will conclude by raising serious questions on the goal of the AI research program.

**Bio: Moshe Y. Vardi is a University Professor and the George Distinguished Service Professor in Computational Engineering at Rice University**. He is the recipient of three IBM Outstanding Innovation Awards, the ACM SIGACT Goedel Prize, the ACM Kanellakis Award, the ACM SIGMOD Codd Award, the Blaise Pascal Medal, the IEEE Computer Society Goode Award, the EATCS Distinguished Achievements Award, the Southeastern Universities Research Association’s Distinguished Scientist Award, the ACM SIGLOG Church Award, the Knuth Prize, and the ACM Allen Newell Award.

He is the author and co-author of over 600 papers, as well as two books: Reasoning about Knowledge and Finite Model Theory and Its Applications. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Mathematical Society the Association for Computing Machinery, the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. He is a member of the US National Academy of Engineering and National Academy of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Science, the European Academy of Science, and Academia Europaea.

He holds seven honorary doctorates. He is currently a Senior Editor of the Communications of the ACM, after having served for a decade as Editor-in-Chief.

**Abstract:** Building models for biological, chemical, and physical systems has traditionally relied on domain-specific intuition about which interactions and features most strongly influence a system. Alternatively, machine-learning methods are adept at finding novel patterns in large data sets and building predictive models but can be challenging to interpret in terms of or integrate with existing knowledge. Our group balances traditional modeling with data-driven methods and optimization to get the best of both worlds. Recently developed for and applied to dynamical systems, sparse optimization strategies can select a subset of terms from a library that best describes data, automatically interfering potential model structures from a broad but well-defined class. I will discuss my group’s application and development of data-driven methods for model selection to 1) recover chaotic systems models from data with hidden variables, 2) discover models for metabolic and temperature regulation in hibernating mammals, and 3) model selection for differential-algebraic-equations. I’ll briefly discuss current preliminary work and roadblocks in developing new methods for model selection of biological metabolic and regulatory networks.

[Workshop Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0IrIAIuK93GJtZVMZL10sENQtEFQXABE)

### Overview

This workshop will convene experts in rare and extreme event detection and characterization representing a broad range of application domains and disciplines, including statistics, machine learning, applied mathematics, space weather, materials science, and climate modeling. The goal is for these experts with complementary backgrounds to identify key challenges and opportunities, with an emphasis on methodologies that may be leveraged across domains. The focus on data-driven methods encompasses recent efforts in machine learning, including physics-informed machine learning and generative models, and how such tools may advance rare and extreme event forecasting. The agenda will also include physics-driven approaches, including simulations, both as a source of fundamental insights into the modeling of rare events and as a mechanism for generating data to complement real-world data used to train data-driven models. This two-day workshop will be held at the University of Chicago on November 21-22, 2024. It will feature lectures from experts across the spectrum of disciplines listed above, panel discussions, poster sessions, and lightning talks.

### Workshop theme and goals

The detection, characterization, and forecasting of rare events play critical roles in many science and engineering settings, including non-destructive testing of materials, space weather and climate forecasting, tipping points in ecological systems, and cascading series of failures in the power grid. In these and other applications, there is growing interest in using data-driven methods (e.g., machine learning) to increase accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. However, many off-the-shelf machine learning tools are ill-suited to the modeling and prediction of rare events *because* they are rare. For instance, a classifier may misclassify all rare events and still have high average accuracy, and generative models may fail to generate samples in the tails of distributions underlying training data. Such failures may not impact standard performance metrics appreciably, but have a heavy impact on downstream scientific inquiry and engineering efforts. In parallel, sophisticated simulation systems provide unique opportunities for methods of the interface of simulation and machine learning. A key objective of the workshop is to develop an understanding of how we can ensure data-driven methods are sensitive to and even exploit rare and extreme events, leverage physical models and simulators, and facilitate the prediction of future incipient failures (e.g., aircraft vulnerabilities or space weather impacts). 

**The goal of this workshop** **is to identify existing tools, open problems, and research opportunities for forecasting and characterizing rare extreme events using data-driven methods.** Our focus with this workshop is on mechanisms that *detect, predict, and characterize* rare and extreme events.

**Abstract:** Envision a world where the trillions of bacteria inhabiting our bodies become the frontier of personalized medicine, having the ability to shape our health, performance and even influence behavior. When in harmony, this teeming world of bacteria offers numerous health benefits. However, a shift in this delicate balance can lead to substantial negative health effects due to contrasting evolutionary objectives. Precision engineering of the gut microbiome that can add, remove or modify functional capabilities of the system holds tremendous therapeutic potential for personalized and precision medicine. However, the complexity of this system that encompasses hundreds of species, unknown interaction networks and mechanisms driving these interactions have precluded our ability to effectively manipulate this system to our benefit. A detailed and quantitative understanding of this system would enable the discovery of molecular and ecological design principles of the system as well as novel control knobs for steering the gut microbiome to desired states. By integrating bottom-up construction of microbial communities with computational models, we reveal the networks of interactions driving microbial community assembly, health-relevant metabolite production and human gut pathogens. Our work provides a foundation for exploring and exploiting the interaction networks driving microbial communities for precision medicine and beyond. Central to our approach, we are developing and applying data-driven mechanistic and machine learning models to predict, understand and design microbial communities.

**!**Dr. Ophelia Venturelli** is an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University.** The Venturelli lab aims to understand and engineer microbiomes using systems and synthetic biology for applications spanning human health, agriculture and bioprocessing. Dr. Venturelli began as an Assistant Professor at UW-Madison in Biochemistry after completing a Life Sciences Research Foundation Fellowship at UC Berkeley. Dr. Venturelli’s postdoctoral research focused on developing data-driven methods to decipher microbial interactions shaping assembly of synthetic human gut microbiomes and strategies to manipulate intracellular resource allocation by exploiting tools from synthetic biology. She received her PhD in Biochemistry and Biophysics in 2013 from Caltech, where she studied single-cell dynamics and the role of feedback loops in a metabolic gene regulatory network. Dr. Venturelli received numerous awards including Shaw Scientist Award (2017), Army Research Office Young Investigator Award (2017), the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation Innovation Award (2019), OVCRGE Early Career Innovator Award (2023), ACS Synthetic Biology Young Investigator Award (2023) and the Thomas Langford Lectureship Award (2024).

# Rebecca Willett (UChicago) – Leveraging Physical Models in Machine Learning

December 12, 2019 10:30 AM – 11:30 AM

John Crerar Library, Kathleen A. Zar Room

## Event Recap

Click [here](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/22623/) for archived information about the event.

Machine learning, at its heart, is the process of learning from examples. However, in many scientific domains, we not only have training data or examples from which to learn, but also physical models of either the data collection mechanism or the underlying physical phenomenon. In this talk, I will describe two settings in which physical models can be incorporated within a machine learning framework to yield improved predictive performance. First, we will consider using training data to help solve ill-posed linear inverse problems such as deblurring, deconvolution, inpainting, compressed sensing, and superresolution. Recent advances in machine learning and image processing have illustrated that it is often possible to learn a regularizer from training data that can outperform more traditional regularizers. We will see that whether or how a forward model is leveraged can significantly impact how many training samples are needed to achieve a target accuracy. Second, we will examine using a combination of observational data and simulated data to improve subseasonal climate forecasts. Treating both types of data as co-equal training samples can bias many learning methods and yield misleading results. I will describe an alternative framework that combines observational data with a correlation graph that can be estimated from large ensemble climate model outputs, and we will see how this approach leads to more accurate forecasts. Finally, we will discuss open problems and future directions at the intersection of machine learning and the physical sciences.

**Sponsor**: Computational Science Seminar sponsored jointly by the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab

**Note:** The seminar will take place at Argonne, but will be live-streamed in the Kathleen A. Zar Room of John Crerar Library for University of Chicago attendees.

[**The Rising Stars in Data Science workshop**](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/event/rising-stars-in-data-science-workshop-autumn-2024/), hosted **November 14-15** by the University of California San Diego in collaboration with the University of Chicago and Stanford University, **focuses on celebrating and fast tracking the careers of exceptional data scientists** at a critical inflection point in their career: the transition to postdoctoral scholar, research scientist, industry research position, or tenure track position. Over the past four years, the Rising Stars workshop has hosted over 130 Rising Stars from nearly 40 institutions.

This fall, the fifth annual Rising Stars workshop will showcase the exciting, innovative data science initiatives at UC San Diego, UChicago and Stanford University. This event will provide PhD students and postdocs the opportunity to plug into these networks, platforms, and opportunities. The workshop also aims to increase representation and diversity in data science by providing a platform and a supportive mentoring network to **navigate academic careers in data science**. All graduate students and postdocs, including those who belong to groups underrepresented in data science, are encouraged to apply, including but not limited to people of all racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, sexual orientations, genders, and persons with disabilities.

The two-day workshop will feature career and research panels, networking and mentoring opportunities, and research talks from the Rising Stars. Participants will gain insights from faculty panels on career development questions such as: how to start your academic career in data science; how to strategically sustain your career through research collaborations, publications, and skill development; and how to form meaningful interdisciplinary collaborations in data science with industry and government partners. Participants will also hear inspiring keynote talks from established, cutting-edge leaders in data science.

# Rising Stars Workshop: Fireside Chat with Prof. Rebecca Willett

January 11, 2021 10:10 AM – 11:00 AM

YouTube

Join us for a fireside chat with Professor [Rebecca Willett](https://voices.uchicago.edu/willett/) to kick off the CDAC Rising Stars in Data Science workshop. Hear from one of the leading experts on AI and data science about how to navigate early careers in data science, how to foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and what’s on the horizon for data science research.

Moderated by Julia Hanson (PhD Candidate, Computer Science)

**Willett Bio:** My research interests include signal processing, machine learning, and large-scale data science. In particular, I have studied methods to leverage low-dimensional models in a variety of contexts, including when data are high-dimensional, contain missing entries, are subject to constrained sensing or communication resources, correspond to point processes, or arise in ill-conditioned inverse problems. This work lies at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics, inverse problems in imaging and network science (including compressed sensing), learning theory, algebraic geometry, optical engineering, nonlinear approximation theory, statistical signal processing, and optimization theory. My group has made contributions both in the mathematical foundations of signal processing and machine learning and in their application to a variety of real-world problems. I have active collaborations with researchers in astronomy, materials science, microscopy, electronic health record analysis, cognitive neuroscience, precision agriculture, biochemistry, and atmospheric science.

*This public event is part of the [CDAC Rising Stars in Data Science workshop](/rising-stars/), an event for celebrating and fast tracking the careers of exceptional data scientists at a critical inflection point in their career: the transition from PhD to postdoctoral scholar, research scientist, or tenure track position.*

**Abstract:** In the quest to meet escalating energy demands, the development of batteries  
boasting significantly higher energy densities than current lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is  
paramount. Next-generation batteries (NGB) such as lithium metal battery emerge as a  
compelling candidate, offering energy densities up to tenfold higher. However, the  
commercialization of most NGBs is hindered by electrolytes exhibiting poor compatibility with  
highly reactive lithium metal. My research at the University of Chicago focuses on addressing  
this daunting challenge through the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning  
(AI/ML). By employing a forward design methodology, which maps molecular structures and  
experimental conditions to electrolyte properties, my work advances the discovery of  
electrolytes that can meet the stringent and disparate requirements of such NGBs. This AI/ML-  
centric approach combining experiments and simulations is pivotal for bringing a paradigm shift  
in global energy landscape. Finally, I will outline some of our future directions that includes  
coupling a self-driven robotic platform with existing AI/ML tools to expedite the fabrication and  
testing of battery materials.

**!Bio:** Dr. Ritesh Kumar received his doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in materials science from Indian Institute of Science, India in 2022, with his dissertation formulating robust strategies for designing efficient functional materials using quantum chemistry-based methods and ML

**Abstract:** While AI has shown tremendous success in many scientific fields, it remains a grand challenge to incorporate physical principles in a systematic manner into the design and training of these models. In this talk, I will introduce Physics-Guided AI, a framework that aims to integrate first-principled physical knowledge into data-driven methods. By combining the best of both worlds, we can significantly improve sample complexity, computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and scientific validity of AI models. I will showcase the applications of this framework to accelerate hypothesis generation and discovery in various scientific disciplines.

**Abstract:** Foundation models like GPT-4 have dramatically altered the modern work landscape for many industries reliant on language tasks, but no equivalent model exists yet for scientific applications. Incorporating foundation models into research workflows could enable unprecedented discoveries that connect traditionally distinct scientific sub-disciplines. However, mainstream foundation models trained on human-scale datasets will be insufficient for analyzing most scientific phenomena — a foundation model for science will require special consideration for the requirements of scientific datasets, especially those with wide dynamic ranges.

In this talk , I will introduce the Polymathic AI initiative: our goal is to accelerate the development of versatile foundation models tailored for numerical datasets and scientific machine learning tasks. The challenge we are undertaking is to build AI models which leverage information from heterogeneous datasets and across different scientific fields, which, contrary to domains like natural language processing, do not share a unifying representation (i.e., text). Such models can then be used as strong baselines or be further fine-tuned by scientists for specific applications. This approach has the potential to democratize AI in science by providing off-the-shelf models that have stronger priors (i.e., background knowledge) for shared general concepts such as causality, measurement, signal processing, and even more specialized shared concepts like wave-like behavior, which otherwise would need to be learned from scratch.I will present our initial papers and projects, including large scientific datasets designed for large scale training “MultiModal Universe” and “The Well”.

**!Bio: Shirley Ho** is a senior research scientist at CCA and she joined the Foundation in 2018 to lead the Cosmology X Data Science group. Her research interests range from cosmology to developing new machine learning methods for scientific data that leverage shared concepts across scientific domains. Ho has extensive expertise in astrophysical theory, observation, and data science. She focuses on novel statistical and machine learning tools to address cosmic mysteries like the origins and fate of the universe.

Ho analyzes data from surveys including ACT, Euclid, LSST, Simons Observatory, SDSS, and Roman Space Telescope to understand our universe’s evolution. She earned her Ph.D. in Astrophysical Sciences from Princeton in 2008 and B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Physics from UC Berkeley in 2004. Ho was previously a Chamberlain and Seaborg Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. She joined Carnegie Mellon as an Assistant Professor in 2011, becoming Cooper Siegel Career Development Chair Professor and tenured Associate Professor. In 2016 she moved to Lawrence Berkeley Lab as a Senior Scientist.

Since 2011, Ho has mentored over 50 postdocs, 10 Ph.D. students, and 20 undergraduates in astrophysics, computer science, and statistics. Her awards include the Macronix Prize, Carnegie Science Award, Blavatnik National Finalist, and the EPS Giuseppe and Vanna Cocconi Prize in Cosmology.

**Abstract:** Networked dynamical systems, such as infrastructure networks, supply chains, biological networks, social networks, and so on, are central to our lives. Yet, they often fail catastrophically when faced with large disturbances arising from extreme events. A wide range of tools from systems theory, such as adaptive control, as well as from AI/machine learning, have been developed to guarantee robustness in these settings. However, they do not scale well, lack guarantees on resulting solutions, and cannot deal with large disturbances that push systems into far-from-equilibrium regimes in which they are not typically designed to operate. In this context, this talk will address the problem of ensuring operational resilience of networked dynamical systems to extreme events/shocks. The key idea is that control algorithms that capture and utilize physical properties or constraints — such as energy dissipation, monotonicity, conservation laws, or symmetries — can lead to scalable designs that can adapt to large disturbances and achieve operational resilience. Specifically, we will discuss (i) physics-informed approaches to learn models of these systems capturing   control-relevant   properties   like dissipativity in nonlinear and non-equilibrium settings, and (ii) scalable and compositional learning-based control designs that leverage these properties to provably guarantee safety and operational resilience.

# Data Storytelling for Nonprofits: Assessing Current Capacity and Needs

October 26, 2023 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM

Virtual Event

Learn how data can help you tell your organization’s story. In this workshop, we will use a data maturity assessment tool to better understand your organization’s current data practices and goals. We will discuss connecting your mission to data practices, developing a data strategy, and identifying the data you have or need to achieve your goals. Participants will leave with a baseline snapshot of their organization’s data maturity and resources to implement learnings.

This workshop is Session 1 of Data Storytelling for Nonprofits, a three-part workshop series from the Data Science Institute. This series is centered on how nonprofit and social sector organizations can leverage data effectively to tell the stories and impact of their work. These workshops will provide you with resources and tools for assessing your data practice, strategies for meaningfully communicating data, and resources for building further data capacity.

This workshop is open to all nonprofit professionals and social sector leaders interested in building data culture and capacity within their organizations. No previous data science experience is required.

This workshop is led by Ari Zickau (they/he), the Community Data Fellows Program Manager with the Data Science Institute at UChicago. The [Community Data Fellows](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/community-data-fellows/) program pairs UChicago data science graduate students with nonprofits to help build data capacity for organization, analytics, visualizations, and more.

*\*\* Registration is currently full; please contact [Ari Zickau](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/ari-zickau/) with any questions. \*\**

## Event Recap

**NOTE: These events will be held remotely, via [Zoom](http://bit.ly/datadispatches). Please [RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-role-of-rapid-bacterial-evolution-in-human-health-and-disease-tickets-105900421010) to receive a link on the day of the talk, or watch [a simulcast at the CDAC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no9_t2yvVWs&feature=youtu.be).**

The human body is home to an astonishing number of microbes, commonly referred to as the ‘microbiome’, which collectively encodes ten times more genes than the human genome itself. Although the human microbiome has been implicated in a multitude of diseases, the full set of biological mechanisms underlying these connections remain unexplored. This project will conduct a large-scale analysis of ‘plasmids’, small pieces of DNA that can be exchanged between different bacterial cells but are not part of the bacterial chromosome by employing the power of most recent high-throughput sequencing strategies and machine learning approaches to investigate relationships among plasmid genetics, microbial community structures, and human health.

# Tianyu Gao (Princeton): Computer Science and DSI Joint Colloquium

Enabling Language Models to Process Information at Scale

April 29, 2025 2:00 PM – 3:00 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 298

Please join us for a Computer Science and DSI joint colloquium.

****Tuesday, April 29****  
****2:00pm – 3:00pm****  
****John Crerar Library, 298****

**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) can effectively internalize knowledge from vast amounts of pre-training data, enabling them to achieve remarkable performance on exam-style benchmarks. Expanding their ability to compile, synthesize, and reason over large volumes of information on the fly will further unlock transformative applications, ranging from AI literature assistants to generative search engines. In this talk, I will present my research on advancing LMs for processing information at scale. (1) I will present my evaluation framework for LM-based information-seeking systems, emphasizing the importance of providing citations for verifying the model-generated answers. Our evaluation highlights shortcomings in LMs’ abilities to reliably process long-form texts (e.g., dozens of webpages), which I address by developing state-of-the-art long-context LMs that outperform leading industry efforts while using a small fraction of the computational budget. (2) I will then introduce my foundational work on using contrastive learning to produce high-performing text embeddings, which form the cornerstone of effective and scalable search. (3) In addition to building systems that can process large-scale information, I will discuss my contributions to creating efficient pre-training and customization methods for LMs, which enable scalable deployment of LM-powered applications across diverse settings. Finally, I will share my vision for the next generation of autonomous information processing systems and outline the foundational challenges that must be addressed to realize this vision.

**!Bio:** Tianyu Gao is a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University, advised by Danqi Chen. His research focuses on developing principled methods for training and adapting language models, many of which have been widely adopted across academia and industry. Driven by transformative applications, such as using language models as information-seeking tools, his work also advances robust evaluation and fosters a deeper understanding to guide the future development of language models. He led the first workshop on long-context foundation models at ICML 2024. He won an outstanding paper award at ACL 2022 and received an IBM PhD Fellowship in 2023. Before Princeton, he received his BEng from Tsinghua University in 2020.

# Tom Griffiths (Princeton): Distinguished Speaker Series

Mapping the heterogeneity of artificial intelligence using the tools of cognitive science

May 6, 2025 11:30 AM – 1:00 PM

John Crerar Library, Room 390

*Part of the [2025 Distinguished Speaker Series.](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/2024-25-distinguished-speaker-series/)*

!

The University of Chicago Data Science Institute, Department of Statistics, Department of Computer Science, and Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics are proud to announce our 2025 Distinguished Speaker Series. Join us for stimulating talks from leading data science researchers exploring and expanding the fundamental methods and approaches that transform large and complex datasets into knowledge and action.

**Abstract:**Rapid progress in artificial intelligence research has led many to predict that we will soon have superhuman artificial general intelligences. I will argue that a more realistic outcome is that we will create systems that are heterogeneously superintelligent, outperforming humans in a wide range of settings but also systematically underperforming in others. I will also argue that the tools we need for understanding this heterogeneity can be found in cognitive science, where researchers have spent decades developing theoretical and empirical methods for making sense of the capabilities of intelligent systems. I will illustrate this argument by discussing some surprising cases where large language models perform poorly in predictable ways (“embers of autoregression”) and recent results showing that both the classic phenomenon of neural networks being insufficiently discrete and the classic phenomenon of thought being overly discrete result in deficits in the performance of fielded AI systems.

**Bio:** [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php) is the Henry R. Luce Professor of Information Technology, Consciousness and Culture in the Departments of Psychology and Computer Science at Princeton University, where he is also the Director of the new AI Lab. His research explores connections between human and machine learning, using ideas from statistics and artificial intelligence to understand how people solve the challenging computational problems they encounter in everyday life. He has made contributions to the development of Bayesian models of cognition, probabilistic machine learning, nonparametric Bayesian statistics, and models of cultural evolution, and his recent work has demonstrated how methods from cognitive science can shed light on modern artificial intelligence systems. Tom completed his PhD in Psychology at Stanford University in 2005, and taught at Brown University and the University of California, Berkeley before moving to Princeton. He has received awards for his research from organizations ranging from the American Psychological Association to the National Academy of Sciences and is a co-author of the book Algorithms to Live By, introducing ideas from computer science and cognitive science to a general audience.

# UnCommon Core | AI and the Future of Work with Career Advancement

May 2, 2025 9:30 AM – 11:00 AM

Ida Noyes Hall

**9:30–11:00 a.m.**

**Friday, May 2**

**Ida Noyes Hall, Third Floor Theater, 1212 E. 59th St.**

Steve Jobs famously called computers a “bicycle for the mind.” Now, in the AI era, we are confronted with a tool perhaps more powerful (is it an e-bike?) and more dangerous (is it an e-scooter?!). In this era of technological transformation, artificial intelligence is redefining the professional landscape faster than ever before. What does the rapid rise of AI mean for the future of work, and how can graduates not just adapt but excel in this dynamic environment? This panel will explore the critical questions that arise as AI becomes increasingly integrated into our careers and our lives.

Transparency—enabling appropriate understanding of AI models or systems—is considered a pillar of Responsible AI. The AI research community and industry have developed an abundance of techniques and artifacts in the hope of achieving transparency, including transparent model reporting, model evaluation, explainable AI (XAI), and communication of model uncertainty. Meanwhile, the human-computer interaction (HCI) community has taken human-centered approaches to these topics, building on its long-standing interests in design to support user understanding and appropriate mental models. In this talk, I will give an overview of common approaches and lessons learned from HCI research on AI transparency. With the recent rise of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-infused systems, I will also reflect on their unique challenges in providing transparency and discuss open questions.

**Bio**: [Q. Vera Liao](http://qveraliao.com/) is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Montréal, where she is part of the FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in AI) group. Her current research interests are in human-AI interaction, explainable AI, and responsible AI, with an overarching goal of bridging emerging AI technologies and human-centered design practices. Prior to joining MSR, she worked at IBM Research, and studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Tsinghua University. She has authored more than 60 peer-reviewed research articles and received many paper awards at ACM and AAAI venues.

**Abstract:** While computational methods have become a mainstay in drug discovery programs, many calculations are too time-consuming to be applied to large datasets. Active learning (AL), a machine learning method used to direct a search iteratively, can enable the application of computationally expensive methods such as relative binding free energy (RBFE) to sets containing thousands of molecules. Moreover, AL can also be applied to virtual screening, enabling the rapid processing of billions of molecules. This presentation will provide an overview of two practical applications of AL in drug discovery.

**Abstract:** The expansive, interdisciplinary nature of astronomy, combined with its open-access culture, makes it an ideal testing ground for exploring how Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate scientific discovery. In this talk, I will present our recent advances in applying LLMs to real-world astronomical challenges. Through self-play reinforcement learning, we demonstrate how LLM agents can conduct end-to-end research tasks in galaxy spectra fitting, encompassing data analysis, strategy refinement, and outlier detection—effectively mimicking human intuition and deep domain knowledge. Our agent, named Mephisto, rediscovered and analyzed the Little Red Dots, a new class of galaxies recently identified by the James Webb Space Telescope. While autonomous research agents like Mephisto could theoretically help analyze all observed sources, the cost of closed-source solutions remains prohibitive for large-scale applications involving billions of objects. To address this limitation, we are developing lightweight, open-source specialized models (AstroSage) and evaluating them against carefully curated astronomical benchmarks. Our research shows that specialized 8B-parameter LLMs can match GPT-4o’s performance on specific tasks when properly pretrained and fine-tuned. Despite ongoing challenges, we see potential in scaling up automated astronomical inference, which could transform how astronomical research is conducted.

**!Bio: Yuan-Sen Ting,** Associate Professor of Astronomy at Ohio State University and an Adjunct Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. Previously, Yuan-Sen held positions as an Associate Professor of Astronomy and Computer Science at the Australian National University, and has held a Visiting Professor position at Tsinghua University and Universiti Malaya. Ting received his Ph.D. in Astrophysics and Astronomy from Harvard University. As a Malaysian native, he  had the privilege of living in seven countries and picking up six languages along the way, truly embracing the role of a global citizen. Ting  completed his concurrent Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at the National University of Singapore and École Polytechnique in France on an Eiffel scholarship. During his studies he was honored with the Institute for Physics Medal and the National Academy of Science Award in Singapore, as well as a NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship.

Post-Ph.D., Yuan-Sen was awarded a NASA Hubble Fellowship, Carnegie-Princeton Fellowship, and IAS Fellowship, enabling him to conduct postdoctoral research at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study. Ting  joined the Australian National University as a tenured faculty member before moving back to the U.S. to join OSU. He has also recognitions as the Humboldt Fellowship, the CCAPP Price Prize, and the ARC DECRA Fellowship. His research harnesses deep learning and artificial intelligence to advance data modeling and statistical inference in astrophysics. He specializes in extracting weak signals from massive datasets to tackle some of the field’s most challenging problems. This work has resulted in over 200 publications, garnering more than 8,000 citations, including a Nature cover story. As the leader of AstroMLab, a collaborative effort with Oak Ridge and Argonne National Laboratories, Ting guides a team of computer scientists and astrophysicists in developing specialized large language models and research agents for astrophysical applications.

Yuan-Sen is deeply committed to promoting science in his home country, Malaysia. He has organized two major astronomy conferences and a summer school there, writes columns for Sin Chew Jit Poh, a leading Chinese newspaper with over a million readers, and has given a TEDx talk in Malaysia and created two TED-Ed videos that have amassed over four million views combined.

# Data Ecology Faculty Co-Director Bridget Fahey Writes About Congressional Authority Over Government Data

Bridget Fahey

Musk’s Madisonian Insight

Elon Musk’s assertion of power over some of the government’s largest and most [sensitive](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/02/doge-god-mode-access/681719/) data systems isn’t merely a contravention of American statutory law, administrative norms, and individual privacy rights. It is an act of constitutional restructuring, and should be understood in those terms.

Musk’s team has [accessed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html) a Department of Treasury database that guides the disbursement of more than $5 trillion in federal funds. It is tussling with senior officials at the [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/irs-blocks-musk-aide-accessing-taxpayer-data-2025-02-21/) over access to tax returns, among the most protected federal data, and at the [Social Security Administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-personal-data.html) over access to data systems containing medical and bank records. A court has temporarily [blocked](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.576070/gov.uscourts.mdd.576070.38.0.pdf) Musk and his team from obtaining data about millions of Americans’ student loans, but only for now. And just last week, Musk sought access to [“the most sensitive of all”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/06/doge-hhs-ssa-data/): a database reflecting ongoing wage and income information for most working Americans.

The Constitution distributes power among the branches of government to prevent its concentration and maintain its balance. It organizes many different forms of power, but particularly significant are the powers that take the form of “instruments,” to borrow James Madison’s term for the government’s material tools. Chief among them, the Constitution commits the “power of the purse” to Congress. By contrast, only the president can wield the power of the sword as the commander in chief of the armed forces. Those two profound instruments, guided by different branches, can also counterbalance each other, as when Congress withholds funding for disfavored armed interventions.

# $1 million NSF grant awarded to Truman Community College and UChicago Data Science Institute educational training program

Applying a Preceptor approach for community college data science education

The Data Science Institute, in partnership with Truman Community College, was awarded a $1 million dollar grant from the National Science Foundation, with four years of guaranteed support, to train the next generation of data science educators. The project will focus on improving access to data science education for Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) and other underrepresented communities.

Specifically, the grant will fund the development of a 2 course introductory data science sequence that is designed to increase the number of community college students who intend to pursue a data science or data science-related career. This sequence is a foundational step to creating a data science associate’s degree. This is part of an [on-going](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/new-uchicago-city-colleges-of-chicago-program-will-train-next-generation-of-data-science-educators/) [collaboration](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/preceptors/) between the City Colleges of Chicago and the Data Science Institute.

Truman College co-leads [Kate Connor](https://highered.aspeninstitute.org/meet-the-rising-presidents-fellows-2021-2022/kate-connor/) and [LaSandra Skinner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lasandra-skinner-259a5a21/) will head the project, with support from DSI’s Co-PIs [Jeanne Century](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/jeanne-century/) and [David Uminsky](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/david-uminsky/). With these funds, Connor and Skinner will develop and establish a model for HSI community college and research university collaboration that other schools can translate to their local settings. The model can then be used by community colleges and research universities to create a path to bring new fields, like data science, into higher education while considering curricular and institutional capacity issues.

> We are excited about the new grant opportunity with the University of Chicago’s DSI and NSF. The support will allow us to document and scale our models for training future faculty and work to expand the data science curriculum available to our students.  The impact of this work will allow us to understand how industries, colleges, and faculty can all come together to train and develop a new workforce at every level required.”
>
> Kate Connor, Faculty in the Department of Education and Human Development at Harry S Truman

UChicago’s DSI will share resources in service of Connor and Skinner’s work. Specifically, they will be able to take an existing University of Chicago introductory data science course for community college students and leverage the UChicago  [Preceptorship program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/new-uchicago-city-colleges-of-chicago-program-will-train-next-generation-of-data-science-educators/) to develop capacity for high quality instruction.

Together, the core goal of the work funded by this grant is to create three scalable models pertaining to data science in community colleges. First, generating a model for introduction to data science courses that are part of a pathway to a data science degree. Second, creating a model for building data science instruction capacity at community colleges using an approach that includes Preceptors with teaching responsibilities at both a university and a community college. Finally, developing a model for community colleges and research institutions to partner in data science and other emerging STEM fields. Together, these models comprise an approach to building capacity in community colleges for data science instruction.

The Data Science Institute is excited to build STEM education capacity in underserved communities by applying a Preceptor approach and course development to create an innovative model for community college data science education.

# 2020 CDAC Summer Lab Kicks Off with 37 Student Researchers

The 2020 Summer Lab is our biggest edition yet, with 37 undergraduate and high school students from around the world studying applied machine learning and AI, human-computer interaction, computational social science, systems, and much more.

Each year, the [Center for Data and Computing Summer Lab](/engage/summerlab/) provides dozens of undergraduate and high school students with a paid, in-person opportunity to experience immersive research in data science and other computational approaches. This year…the “in-person” part didn’t seem so wise. But despite its remote format, the 2020 Summer Lab will be the biggest edition yet, with 37 students from around the world working as research assistants with 29 faculty or staff mentors, studying applied machine learning and AI, human-computer interaction, computational social science, systems, and much more.

Over the next ten weeks, Summer Lab students will contribute to innovative research that bridges data science and computational approaches with applications in physics, archeology, public policy, and many other fields. And they’ll do it from their homes around the United States, Europe, and Asia, meeting virtually with their mentors and peers through a variety of channels and events.

“What the program really offers is exposure to cutting-edge, interdisciplinary data and computational science — the entire lifecycle of data science,” said [Kyle Chard](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/kyle-chard/), Summer Lab program director and research assistant professor with the University of Chicago Department of Computer Science. “Often, this is the first chance these students have to conduct research, and we focus on making sure that they see the opportunities and the excitement of science.”

This week, the first half of the student cohort kicked off their summer with an online orientation, the first of many remote events that will preserve the important community aspect of the program. Students will engage in workshops, weekly panels and talks, and even trivia nights and scavenger hunts.

“The real success that we enjoyed last year was seeing students really come into their own through research and participating in the cohort,” said Katherine Rosengarten, CDAC administrative specialist and co-organizer of Summer Lab. “The cohort isn’t something that you can make happen; you can only help build and foster it, and we do that through a balance of exciting, rigorous research work and community-based fun.”

For the first time, the students will also participate in an “on-ramp” technical workshop, presented in partnership with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), and communicate via a program Slack channel, sharing knowledge and experiences across multiple time zones. 

“We’ve learned in the past that the students learn as much from their peers as they do from their mentors, so I think that’s a particularly strong part of this program,” Chard said. 

This year’s class of 37 builds upon last year’s cohort of 28 students in the inaugural year of the CDAC Summer Lab (the program succeeded the Computation Institute summer research program, started in 2012). Like last year, the group is over half women and minorities underrepresented in computer science — which the team credited to expanded efforts to reach a broad range of students and schools and encourage all to apply, regardless of prior research experience. The outreach was a success, generating more than 300 applications, three times higher than 2019.  

The range of project topics available to this year’s students also doubled from last year, with mentors coming from 13 different departments and centers at the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermilab. But even last year’s smaller cohort made significant contributions to science, earning co-authorship on seven papers or posters accepted to major academic conferences and helping develop new research software.

“What I love about the CDAC Summer Lab program is that it’s serious about really supporting and mentoring the next generation of data scientists,” said Julia Koschinsky, executive director of the [Center for Spatial Data Science](http://spatial.uchicago.edu). “We’ve worked with high school and College students who are exploring how they can apply their interests in computer science, physics, and math in a research and job context. By the end of the summer, they helped develop Python packages and AWS tools that will be released through the widely used PySAL library. After the Summer Lab, we continue to support students with recommendation letters and job connections and are proud that they just got accepted to Harvard’s CS program and to Princeton and others are now applying to internships at NASA and IBM. They’re on their way!”

“We’ve seen students come out of the program and co-author papers, or work on open source tools that are now being used by thousands of people,” Rosengarten said. “In their time in the program, they made friendships, they make connections, some are now working in labs of faculty that they worked with, and they’re starting to claim their own territory as researchers in a way that is not easy to do when you’re a student.”

# 2023 Rising Stars in Data Science visit UChicago to advance their post-doctoral careers

The University of Chicago’s DSI hosted the [Rising Stars in Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/postdoctoral-programs/rising-stars/) workshop on November 13-14, in collaboration with the [University of California San Diego Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/)). The workshop focuses on celebrating and fast-tracking the careers of exceptional data scientists at a critical inflection point in their career: the transition to postdoctoral scholar, research scientist, industry research position, or tenure track position.

!

This annual workshop began three years ago, and has since hosted 135 Rising Stars from 44 institutions. This fall was the fourth workshop, with [32 scholars](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/postdoctoral-programs/rising-stars-in-data-science-2/2023-rising-stars/) in attendance across the two-day event.

#### Panels and Keynotes shed light on becoming a university faculty member

The Rising Stars workshop consists of career and research panels, networking and mentoring opportunities, and research talks from the Rising Stars. On November 13th, participants heard from [Aloni Cohen](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/aloni-cohen/), [Rana Hanocka](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/rana-hanocka/), [Nikos Ignatiadis](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/nikolaos-nikos-ignatiadis/), and Haojian Jin (UC San Diego) as part of the panel, “The Data Science Job Search – Advice from New Faculty.” Alex Cloninger (UC San Diego) moderated the session, where participants asked questions about tailoring their materials for specific departments, the pros and cons of younger versus older departments, and how to negotiate once an offer is made.

The following day included three panels addressing different focuses. [David Uminsky](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/david-uminsky/) kicked off the first panel as moderator, with panelists [Mike Franklin](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/michael-j-franklin/), [Becca Willett](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/rebecca-willett/), and Virginia De Sa (UC San Diego) revealing how search committees select candidates. The panelists stressed the importance of getting great letters and delivering an excellent job talk. They noted that successful candidates must be willing to engage with tough questions about their work and should have a clear research vision.

!

The second panel of the day, “How to Make the Most of Your First Year,” featured Mike Franklin moderating for [Alex Kale](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/alex-kale/), [Molly Offer-Westort](https://codas.uchicago.edu/people/molly-offer-westort/), [Raul Castro Fernandez](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/raul-castro-fernandez/), Gal Mishne (UC San Diego), and Alex Cloninger. All the panelists spoke passionately on topics such as the top three priorities when starting a new faculty position, work-life balance, and tips for recruiting graduate students.

The third and final panel was moderated by Molly Offer-Westort and consisted of Rising Star alumni Maarten Sap, Haojian Jin, and Jonatas Marques. These researchers discussed their experiences being on the job market and gave advice on how to thrive in interdisciplinary fields.

!

Attendees also heard inspiring keynote talks from established, cutting-edge leaders in data science. [Bo Li](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/bo-li/) spoke about how to assess the trustworthiness of AI systems and Virginia De Sa discussed using machine learning to investigate visual and multi-sensory perception. Both presenters focused on the interdisciplinary nature of data science research, their experiences collaborating across research areas, and how machine learning can be leveraged as a tool across many domains.

#### Rising Stars shine during their Lightning Talks

!!

!

The Rising Stars workshop provides a platform to showcase the exciting work of PhD students and postdocs. Lighting talks are rapid, 10-minute presentations presented by all participants on their research. These talks were grouped based on topic and scattered across the two day workshop. Topics included Natural Language Processing, Data-Driven Decision Making, Fairness and Interpretability, Health and Medicine, Data and Society, AI in Science and Technology, Machine Learning, and Optimization. All lightning talk abstracts can be found on the 2023 Rising Stars [cohort page](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/postdoctoral-programs/rising-stars-in-data-science-2/2023-rising-stars/). Here’s a highlight of the depth and breadth of the research at RISING stars..

Sam Zhang, University of Colorado Boulder: Labor advantages drive the greater productivity of faculty at elite universities

“Faculty at prestigious institutions dominate scientific discourse, producing a disproportionate share of all research publications. Environmental prestige can drive such epistemic disparity, but the mechanisms by which it causes increased faculty productivity remain unknown. Here, we combine employment, publication, and federal survey data for 78,802 tenure-track faculty at 262 PhD-granting institutions in the American university system to show through multiple lines of evidence that the greater availability of funded graduate and postdoctoral labor at more prestigious institutions drives the environmental effect of prestige on productivity. In particular, greater environmental prestige leads to larger faculty-led research groups, which drive higher faculty productivity, primarily in disciplines with group collaboration norms. In contrast, productivity does not increase substantially with prestige for faculty publications without group members or for group members themselves. The disproportionate scientific productivity of elite researchers can be largely explained by their substantial labor advantage rather than inherent differences in talent.”

Emily Aiken, University of California, Berkeley: Targeting humanitarian aid with machine learning and digital data

“The vast majority of humanitarian aid and social protection programs globally are targeted, providing assistance to individuals or communities identified to be poorest or most in need. In low and middle-income countries, the targeting of aid programs is often limited by low-quality, out-of-date, or missing data on poverty and vulnerability. Novel “big” digital data sources, such as those captured by satellites, mobile phones, and financial services providers — when combined with advances in machine learning — can improve the accuracy of aid program targeting. In this talk, I will cover empirical results on the accuracy of these new data-driven and algorithmic approaches to aid allocation, and will discuss emergent implications for fairness, privacy, transparency, and community dynamics.”

Ying Jin, Stanford University: Model-free selective inference with conformal p-values and its application in drug discovery

“In decision-making or scientific discovery pipelines such as job hiring and drug discovery, before any resource-intensive step, there is often an initial screening step that uses predictions from a machine learning model to shortlist a few candidates from a large pool. We introduce a framework that allows using any prediction model to select candidates whose unobserved outcomes exceed user-specified values, while rigorously controlling the false positives. Given a set of calibration data that are exchangeable with the test sample, we leverage conformal inference ideas to construct p-values that allow us to shortlist candidates with exact false discovery rate (FDR) control. In addition, I will discuss new ideas to further deal with covariate shifts between calibration and test samples, a scenario that occurs in almost all such problems including drug discovery, hiring, causal inference, and healthcare. Our methods are flexible wrappers around any complex model. In practical drug discovery tasks, our methods greatly narrow the set of promising drug candidates to manageable sizes while maintaining rigorous FDR control.”

# A day at Google for UChicago’s MS in Applied Data Science students

MS in Applied Data Science Students spend the day at Google

Thirty students from the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) embarked on an exciting adventure on May 20th: a visit to the Google office. This trip was a reward for their completion of the Career Course, a class designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge to navigate the job market.

The day started with a fun icebreaker – students introduced themselves and shared their favorite Google product. The range was impressive, from everyday tools such as Google Calendar to cutting-edge data science solutions like the recently launched large language model Gemini. Next, students got an insider’s perspective through presentations from seven Googlers, each detailing their typical workday experiences.

The highlight for many students was access to [Google Labs](https://labs.google), a digital playground for experimenting with the latest AI tools and testing hypotheses. Students explored projects such as Generative AI with Vertex AI and Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Vertex AI Gemini API.

To wrap up the visit, students toured the Google office, complete with well-stocked snack rooms, an arcade for work breaks, and a unique workspace – an old CTA train car on the rooftop, equipped with Wi-Fi!

#### **Student perspective**

The trip left a lasting impression on the students. Jean-Sebastien Gaultier, a current student in the program, said: “The invitation to Google was a great surprise! Meeting professionals in different sectors of Google Cloud gave me a great idea of the inner workings of Google. The amazing office spaces further enhanced the experience. Working in a 10-story building dedicated to collaboration is inspiring – who wouldn’t want to work at Google after seeing the office?”

Another student, Pamela Gonzalez Muniz, found the Google AM/ML Solutions presentation particularly captivating. “Learning that so many of today’s leading AI technologies originated at Google was fascinating.” She went on to say that gaining insights into future trends and tools was invaluable. What surprised Gonzalez Muniz the most was the well-rounded nature of Google’s employee roles. She noted that all of the presenters possessed strong technical skills, business acumen, and excellent interpersonal abilities.

# Applied Data Science Students Craft AI-Powered Storytelling App

When a frustrated 4-year-old yelled at an Amazon Alexa for failing to tell the exact story she imagined—one about her favorite princess going to swimming class—a seed of inspiration was planted. This moment became the foundation for an [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) capstone project. Recognizing how children crave personalized, meaningful stories yet face limitations with existing technology, a team of students decided to take on the challenge. Their solution? ***Once Upon***, an AI-powered storytelling app designed to bring a child’s creativity to life.

*!“That experience showed how much children want to hear stories that are unique and personally meaningful to them,”*the team shared,*“yet existing technology struggled to meet that need.”*

The team—Hima Cheruvu, Nia Gangar, Rishika Ravindran, and Christian Piantanida—set out to build an app that wouldn’t just tell stories, but would empower children to shape their own. *Once Upon* uses **artificial intelligence** to generate dynamic, age-appropriate stories based on prompts provided by a child, transforming their ideas into engaging narratives.

#### **Bringing Data Science to Life**

The capstone project, which spans two academic quarters, immerses students in a real-world challenge where they apply their data science skills to develop innovative solutions for real clients. Designed to simulate the full lifecycle of a data science project—from concept to execution—it gave the team an opportunity to showcase the power of data science in an accessible and impactful way.

The team described their approach:

* **Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing (NLP):** These techniques powered the app’s ability to craft personalized, child-friendly stories in real-time.
* **Data Engineering:** A robust pipeline was designed to seamlessly handle user prompts and model outputs.
* **Collaboration & Iterative Design:** By gathering feedback from potential users—children, parents, and educators—the team refined *Once Upon* to be intuitive, engaging, and fun.

*“This hands-on project really cemented our ability to translate technical knowledge into real-world solutions,”* the team explained. The [capstone project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/) served as a culmination of their learning, bridging theory with practical application.

#### **A Standout Experience**

So, what made *Once Upon* stand out at the capstone showcase? !

According to the team, it was the combination of creativity, technology, and user engagement. “We didn’t just present a product; we created an experience,” they said. By allowing judges to interact with the app—choosing their own prompts and seeing stories come to life in real-time—the team demonstrated the magic of their AI-powered tool.

The judges were drawn to the app’s ability to solve a relatable problem: children’s desire for stories that reflect their imaginations. The team’s energetic presentation, whimsical theme, and innovative technology resonated with the audience, earning them **Best in Show** recognition and making *Once Upon* a highlight of the [Capstone Showcase.](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/masters-in-applied-data-science-autumn-2024-capstone-showcase/)

#### **Final Reflections**

For the team, the capstone showcase marked a rewarding culmination of their journey through the MS in Applied Data Science program.

“It was exciting to see so many creative projects and to share *Once Upon* with the judges and our peers,” they reflected. “We’re incredibly proud of what we accomplished and grateful for the opportunity to apply the skills we’ve developed in such a meaningful way.”

With *Once Upon*, the team not only demonstrated their technical expertise but also showed how data science can inspire creativity, innovation, and meaningful impact—one story at a time.

For those interested in a deeper dive into *Once Upon*, you can explore the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cpiantanida12/OnceUpon/blob/master/README.md) and watch the [video demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vas3zjByW-XM6-QMLc-g5KkILYxMFDv0/view?usp=sharing%22%20%5Ct%20%22_new) showcasing the app in action.

# Applying to the MS in Applied Data Science Program? Here’s What We Look For

Before you submit your MS in Applied Data Science application, explore some key traits we look for in our candidates.

Thinking about applying to the [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program at the University of Chicago? We’re thrilled to have you here! Our program is designed for ambitious problem-solvers ready to make a difference in fields ranging from healthcare to finance and beyond. To help you put your best foot forward, we’re sharing a few key traits we look for in applicants. Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist looking to level up your career or considering a career switch to data science, here’s what you need to know to stand out and succeed.

**Trait #1: Some Prior Experience with Python or R**

Let’s start with the basics. No, we don’t need you to be a coding wizard (though, if you are, that’s awesome!). But you should have dabbled a bit in Python or R. What does that mean? If someone says, “Download this library in Jupyter Notebook,” you shouldn’t be scratching your head. Instead, you should be nodding along, maybe even excited to try it out.

Know your data types—strings, Booleans, integers, floats, all that jazz. And if you’ve played around with data frames or created some basic data visualizations, you’re on the right track.

If this sounds foreign, don’t panic! There are great resources to help you get up to speed without breaking the bank. Daniel Truesdale, one of our own, started with the Coursera course “[Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python).” He also honed his skills through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) competitions.

In short, you don’t need a technical background, but some familiarity with Python or R is key.

**Trait #2: Collaboration is Key**

Our students are movers and shakers, ready to make an impact in tech, finance, sports, media, healthcare, education, government, logistics—you name it. Transitioning from theory to real-world impact means working well with others. We look for students who are:

* **Team Players**: You’re comfortable working alongside people from different backgrounds and perspectives.
* **Community Builders**: You want to be part of our community, help build it, and stay connected even after graduation.

You’ll learn a lot from our faculty, but also from your classmates. Grad school is as much about building your network as it is about hitting the books.

**Trait #3: Be Authentic**

Just be yourself. We don’t expect you to be a master of math, statistics, and programming before you even start (otherwise, why would you need us?). Be open about where you need to grow, but also proud of what you bring to the table.

Authenticity goes a long way. It helps us understand who you are and how you’ll fit into and contribute to our community.

So, if you’re thinking about applying, keep these traits in mind. We can’t wait to see what you’ll bring to the University of Chicago!

**Trait #4: Relax and communicate effectively**

Students must submit a video recording of themselves answering one question as part of their application requirements, a second video prompt is optional. Practice presenting in front of the camera and review the video before submitting. Make sure you are speaking loudly and calmly. We encourage students to not read off of a script so you do not sound robotic. This is a chance for students to show their personality and effective communication skills. Also, it is recommended for students to treat the video requirement as if they are interviewing for a position; professional attire is encouraged.

Presenting is common in our program, don’t worry if it’s not perfect as students will have plenty of opportunities to practice in the program.

# Assistant Professor Raul Castro Fernandez Awarded NSF CAREER Grant to investigate Data-sharing Markets

Assistant Professor Raul Castro Fernandez from the University of Chicago’s Department of Computer Science secured the prestigious NSF CAREER grant that will support research on incentivizing data sharing.

Assistant Professor [Raul Castro Fernandez](https://raulcastrofernandez.com) of the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago has been awarded the prestigious [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov) (NSF) CAREER grant. This grant, known for supporting early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education, will bolster Castro Fernandez’s research on what he calls “data ecology”.

!

“The expression ‘follow the money’ presents ‘money’ as a form of power,” Castro Fernandez states. “My research emphasizes data as a form of power. ‘Follow the data’ requires characterizing what dataflows occur in an environment.”

He defines dataflow as an abstraction that describes the movement of data between entities. Sometimes, dataflows transform data in a positive manner, but other times they create havoc. The focus of data ecology is to study how to control dataflows to design data environments that work according to specification, reaping the value of data while avoiding its harms. His group works on developing the principles of data ecology and applying them to many data environments, including data sharing among employees in an organization, data markets, and more. Data-sharing is increasingly important; consider organizations that want to share data to achieve a larger common good, such as hospitals or banks pooling data to improve healthcare or fraud detection, or machine learning researchers combining datasets to train data-hungry large language models. The NSF CAREER grant will support Castro Fernandez’s work on incentivizing the creation of “data-sharing markets”.

Continuing with the examples he mentioned previously, sharing healthcare data has the potential to improve patient care, while sharing bank data could improve their fraud detection capabilities and would ultimately benefit customers. While there are many upsides to sharing data, it involves disclosing potentially sensitive information, which could turn around and hurt the participants. Castro Fernandez research explores opportunities to design data-sharing markets by combining economic, technical, and socio-technical incentives to bring about a socially beneficial data-sharing consortia that can benefit the above scenarios.

“While these cases motivate our research, we are concentrating on building a software platform,” Castro Fernandez states. “If it works as expected, there will be other use cases we did not anticipate. That’s an advantage of designing and implementing abstractions instead of point solutions, and this is an important goal for this research. I am excited about applying these ideas in practice and look forward to doing so.”

Castro Fernandez is grateful that NSF is funding the effort to study and implement data sharing market systems, and he is looking forward to working on this proposal. On top of the existing classes he teaches outside of research (Introduction to Database Systems and [Ethics, Responsibility, Fairness, and Privacy in Data Science](http://raulcastrofernandez.com/DATA-25900-Spring24/schedule.html)), he plans to continue teaching “The Value of Data” class next Fall, a class he started when he joined UChicago to explore the agenda of data ecology.

# Bringing Transparency to Carbon Credit Projects

DSI worked with International nonprofit GRAIN to develop a new dataset on carbon credit land projects.

A new [dataset](https://airtable.com/app676ETan5GMQGEq/shrPG60NRRI1Ui24R/tblLR7Mrvp0xbSQME) compiled by GRAIN and the University of Chicago Data Science Institute (DSI) shines a light on the ‘carbon credit’ market, the system of trading and regulating credits that allow a company or individual to emit a specific amount of greenhouse gasses. The dataset identifies 279 large-scale tree and crop-planting carbon credit projects that corporations have initiated across the world since 2016. GRAIN released the dataset with an [accompanying report](https://grain.org/en/article/7190-from-land-grabbers-to-carbon-cowboys-a-new-scramble-for-community-lands-takes-off) that highlights the social and environmental impacts of these ‘land deal’ projects. 

[GRAIN](https://grain.org) is an international non-profit organization that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems. As part of their research and advocacy efforts, GRAIN tracks information about land deals for carbon farming to encourage oversight and monitor their impacts to local communities’ sovereignty. 

!

Map by DSI (Trevor Spreadbury) and GRAIN using data from the new carbon credits datasets.

GRAIN’s goal was to collect and expand the information in leading carbon credit databases and combine them with important details from identified articles of interest. This allowed for the creation of a dataset of carbon farming land acquisition deals across the globe. The DSI brought technical expertise in working with complex data sources, building automated pipelines, as well as visualizing and communicating that data to make this project possible. 

Carbon credits or carbon offsets are generated by projects designed to either reduce emissions or capture and store carbon. A credit is a transferable financial instrument that represents an emission reduction that has been verified by a government or independent certification body. In its most basic form, a company buys land, plants trees, and gets a certification company to provide them a number of carbon credits equivalent to the number of tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent their action reduced or removed from the environment. These carbon credits can then be sold to companies that are interested in advertising better net emissions.

Working with GRAIN’s staff, DSI software engineer Trevor Spreadbury parsed available information to build the dataset of carbon farming projects that met the following criteria: projects that involve the large-scale planting of crops and/or tree species on a combined area of land over 100 hectares for the purpose of producing carbon credits; are driven by companies from outside the communities; were initiated since 2016 and up to March 31, 2024 (roughly post-Paris Agreement); and are located in the global South. 

These projects involve over 9 million hectares of land in the global South– an area roughly the size of Portugal. The most affected region, in terms of land area, is Africa, with projects covering over 5.2 million hectares.

Using this dataset, GRAIN found that 52 countries in the global South have been targeted by carbon farming projects. Half the projects are in just four countries: China, India, Brazil and Colombia. However, projects in these countries account for less than a third of the total land area involved. The most affected region, in terms of land area, is Africa, with projects covering over 5.2 million hectares. For a breakdown of projects by country and region based on this dataset, see [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_tbJjapr6gwgVXlA4cxot7FxbnhmCP8kQbKh173sf5A/.). 

The collaboration was made possible in part by [The 11th Hour Project](https://11thhourproject.org), a program of [The](https://tsffoundation.org) [Schmidt Family Foundation](https://tsffoundation.org). The DSI serves as a centralized hub for software and data science for 11th Hour Project grantees. DSI research staff work to lower the barriers to mission-driven data science through education, consultation, project-based applications and collaboration.

# CAN Social Impact Summer Experience Symposium Showcases Impactful Student Research

!

On a Friday in late June, 24 students gathered to unveil the results from their summer research as part of the [Capacity Accelerator Network](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/capacity-accelerator-network/)’s Social Impact Summer Experience. After a two-week intensive training on data science techniques and research methodology, the undergraduate and master’s students were unleashed to work with partner social impact organizations, using their newly acquired data science skills to benefit nonprofits and influence policy. 

The Summer Experience students worked with partner social impact organizations such as [RAFI-USA](https://www.rafiusa.org/) and the [Chicago Public Library](https://www.chipublib.org/), researching in small groups and using their data science skills to benefit others and influence policy. Professors and preceptors from the University of Chicago assisted the students in their research, as did professors from the diverse group of Capacity Accelerator Network partner institutions: North Carolina State University, Morehouse College, Howard University, City Colleges of Chicago, Fresno State, the University of Texas at San Antonio, and the University of Illinois Chicago.

Each project highlighted the need for data science training as an accessible resource for communities facing complicated problems. The students were pleased with their results, as were their preceptors and facilitators. “During the summer, students applied a variety of data science techniques to address important issues in their communities. Many were also exposed to potential academic paths and careers that they were unaware of prior to participating in the CAN Social Impact Summer Experience,” said Mario Bañuelos, Associate Professor of Mathematics and CAN DSSI Summer Experience Visiting Faculty Co-Director.

The student’s projects and their impacts are summarized below.

### Understanding the long term effects of pesticides on disenfranchised communities

Students Isaiah Gonzalez, Shana McDowell, Folasade Fanegan, and Grace Simunek studied the use of pesticides alongside [Californians for Pesticide Reform](https://www.pesticidereform.org/). Using tools from spatial data science and modeling, they investigated years of pesticide and census data, finding that areas with a larger Latino population tended to have more pesticide use, which can lead to higher rates of cancer and acute illness. Simunek shared that she was surprised and disturbed when she learned that pesticides cause cancer and can drift from the areas where they’re applied. She added that, while the government of California regulates pesticide application, pesticide drift is not regulated. Gonzalez added that, as a student from Fresno, this research hits close to home. He described the odor emitted from the fields across the street from his home when they’re sprayed with pesticides. For Gonzalez, this research highlighted the severity of the pesticide problem in California. 

### Who benefits in Illinois from state contracts

In partnership with the [Illinois Commission on Equity and Inclusion](https://cei.illinois.gov/), Eke Agbai, Kennedy Coleman, Joseph Jaiyeola, and Santiago Segura assessed equity around state use of vendors from diverse communities. The Illinois Business Enterprise Program (BEP) encourages state contracts with minorities, women, and people with disabilities. The group mapped the locations of businesses that worked with the state of Illinois; investigated how the number of bids, number of contracts, and contract values varied by area; and looked at how those variables correlated with demographic data. They found that areas where more residents have bachelor’s degrees tend to have more bids and that vendors are clustered around densely populated areas. The tools they built, including models and an interactive map, can be updated as new data are collected. In the future, their research might help the state use their contract funding more strategically.

### Book lending and internet access: how Chicago Public Library use differs across neighborhoods

Rajiv Shah, Danielle Hahn, Tasnim Alqudah, and Abby Reynolds worked with the [Chicago Public Library (CPL)](https://www.chipublib.org/) for their project. They researched how library use varies spatially and temporally, and investigated the relationship between library use and demographic data. The group found that neighborhoods with higher income and employment rates tend to have higher circulation and lower computer use, while neighborhoods with lower income and employment have higher computer use but less circulation. They also found that there are no large differences in average walking time to a library between racial groups. Young people and high school graduates tend to be located in areas closer to libraries, so the researchers suggested that CPL should consider areas with older residents and lower high school graduation rates when deciding where to build new libraries. In the future, the students recommended further research on community perceptions of the value of the library to better target resources where they are desired.

### Chicago’s South Side suffers more internet disruptions than other neighborhoods

Ronald Carter Jr., Lizet Casas, Kristen Haddadin, and Moturi Ondeyo used [Internet Equity Initiative](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/) (IEI) data to study disruptions in Internet service. After a recent major federal investment in broadband access, data that can show us where to prioritize funding is more important than ever. The IEI, one of the Data Science Institute’s research initiatives, placed devices in homes around Chicago and beyond to monitor internet speed and disruption. The Summer Experience Researchers used these data to build an interactive dashboard through which users can investigate differences in Internet disruption across space and time. Using their dashboard, the team found that the South Side of Chicago had the most Internet disruptions in 2022, and Chicago had more anomalies than other cities. Now that the team has learned more about where and when Internet disruptions occur, they suggested further research into the root causes of these anomalies.

### When you can’t see an eye care provider

Alongside [Preventing Blindness](https://preventblindness.org/), a national nonprofit based in Chicago, students Adrian Gutierrez, Alex Herrejon, Myles Ndiritu, and Vira Kasprova studied where eye care providers are located and how access varies by region. They contextualized their research by sharing that more than 7 million Americans have permanent vision problems, and more than half of these cases were preventable. Using data from the U.S. census, National Eyecare Provider, and Medicare, the group produced maps and regressions. They concluded that vulnerable populations live fairly close to eye care facilities and most people live in a census tract with some access to vision providers. There doesn’t seem to be a geographic access issue, so they suggested that future research could look at other potential barriers preventing access to eye care.

### Grocery chain consolidation: good for the brand, bad for consumers

Kenthia Roberts, David Sampedro, Sebastian Plaza, and Amir Harris worked with RAFI-USA to study the potential impacts of the Kroger/Albertsons grocery store merger. In 2021, nearly 70% of the grocery market was controlled by four brands. Albertsons and Kroger are two of those companies, and their proposed merger would further consolidate and concentrate the market. Focusing on data from 2022, the research team quantified how the merger would increase the newly consolidated company’s market share, decrease consumer choice, and cause the loss of approximately 50,000 jobs. Their study suggests that the merger would help Kroger/Albertsons compete with Costco and Walmart, a potential upside, but would be a bad deal for consumers and farmers. It would especially affect those in rural and micropolitan regions, who are more susceptible to unfair pricing. The researchers concluded that responsible oversight is essential.

The relationships that the Data Science Institute has developed with partner institutions and social impact organizations paid off for the CAN Social Impact Summer Experience cohort. The students developed important new skills in computing, collaboration, and interdisciplinary research. In just a short amount of time, these scientists produced high-impact research and learned about the myriad ways in which data science can be applied to enact social change. Executive Director of the Data Science Institute David Uminsky was pleased with the student’s hard work, stating “It was extraordinary to see the students make such rapid progress on these hard but impactful research problems. I’m grateful for all the partnership organizations that provided such high quality data science projects as well as the faculty from across the CAN network and project mentors who provided great guidance all summer.”

[Elizabeth Tung](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/elizabeth-tung), Medicine

Cardiovascular disease is the #1 killer of American adults. Preliminary data suggest that community social risk factors such as violent crime events, closures of food stores or pharmacies, and outages along critical mass transit lines are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events and worsened control of cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol. The project will determine how community stressors relate to cardiovascular events and develop a prediction model and a prototype software tool to identify patients at highest risk for cardiovascular events during their periods of peak risk, so that healthcare providers can more efficiently target interventions to the patients who need them most.

[Andrey Rzhetsky](https://genes.uchicago.edu/directory/andrey-rzhetsky-phd), Medicine, Human Genetics  
[Pedro Lopes](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/profile/pedro-lopes/), Computer Science

A large sector of the medical profession in Nigeria lacks traditional decision making systems because of inadequate internet infrastructure, and the country has no electronic medical records. This project will build a mobile system running on conventional Android devices that allows doctors in this region to access basic medical records and perform queries (such as “side effects of diazepam”) over encrypted text messages, as well as access real-time information on the spread of diseases such as contagious infections.

## **Racial Inequality in Financial Resilience**

[Pascal Noel](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/n/pascal-noel), Booth School of Business

How do income instability and access to resources shape racial inequality? This project will use administrative data to construct the first estimates of financial resilience by race. Using anonymized data from millions of bank accounts to measure income and spending on a day-to-day basis, the researchers will study how households cope with difficult economic shocks such as job loss and measure financial resilience by whether household members cut back on grocery spending, skip doctors appointments, and miss bill payments. This project may uncover a new dimension of racial inequality, one with significant welfare and policy implications.

[David Jablonski](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/david-jablonski/), Geophysical Sciences

Understanding the impact of climate change on the diversity of global marine species has important economic value for fishery and policy making. Changes in water temperature, nutrients, and ecological associations can affect an organism’s physical form and growth, which are critical to determining where a species can survive. Using modern 3D imaging technology, this project will quantify large-scale variations in bivalve shell morphology and statistically analyze how they respond to global climate change by developing highly efficient end-to-end geometric deep learning systems that can automatically extract latent semantic representations from millions of micro-CT scans.

[David Miller](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-miller/), Physics

Machine learning methods are becoming essential for high energy physics experiments at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, existing ML algorithms typically do not account for underlying symmetry properties of the physical systems and interactions of interest, and must learn, often imperfectly, the phenomenological implications of any symmetries involved. This project will develop a new approach based on a novel type of covariant neural network architecture called N-body networks, and will develop a Lorentz invariant neural network software library for systems of particles whose properties are invariant under generalized Lorentz transformations.

[Michael Yu](https://www.ttic.edu/faculty/yu/), TTIC

The human body is home to an astonishing number of microbes, commonly referred to as the ‘microbiome’, which collectively encodes ten times more genes than the human genome itself. Although the human microbiome has been implicated in a multitude of diseases, the full set of biological mechanisms underlying these connections remain unexplored. This project will conduct a large-scale analysis of ‘plasmids’, small pieces of DNA that can be exchanged between different bacterial cells but are not part of the bacterial chromosome by employing the power of most recent high-throughput sequencing strategies and machine learning approaches to investigate relationships among plasmid genetics, microbial community structures, and human health.

[Karen Livescu](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~klivescu/), TTIC

The procedural language law enforcement officers use to communicate with each other can help us understand the institutional, individual, and contextual factors driving the outcomes of policing incidents. Using a public archive of law enforcement radio communications in the City of Chicago (~45,000 hours of observation), the project will develop a data processing pipeline capable of transforming these broadcast communications into transcripts of discrete policing incidents. This novel data source will allow researchers to test the linguistic antecedents to adverse outcomes, such as uses of force, involving minority male youth.

## **Disentangling Visual Style and Content**

[Jason Salavon](http://www.salavon.com/), Visual Arts  
[Greg Shakhnarovich](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~gregory/), TTIC

How does a young child learn that a plush toy, a crude drawing, and a photograph are all distinct representations of the same content, such as a bear? Embedded in this question is a requirement to disentangle the content of visual input from its form of delivery. These concerns are important to many domains, including computer vision and the creation of visual culture. This project considers the problem of formalizing the concepts of ‘style’ and ‘content’ in images and video. Despite their importance, and our intuitive understanding of these distinctions, there are no compelling and technically useful definitions of these concepts. The researchers will investigate possible ways to define them and operationalize these definitions to improve the state of the art in style transfer and image analysis, as well as produce novel AI-driven visual artifacts.

## **Rational Protein Engineering using Data-Driven Generative Models**

[Andrew Ferguson](https://ime.uchicago.edu/andrew_ferguson/), Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering  
[Rama Ranganathan](http://ranganathanlab.org/), Biochemistry

The rational design of proteins to perform particular functions is a grand challenge in modern science with the potential to revolutionize medicine, materials, and engineering. The primary obstacle is the vast size of protein sequence space making trial-and-error search intractable. This project will establish a platform encompassing a model for functional proteins that can be used to rationally design new candidates, a “gene machine” to prototype designs, and high-throughput quantitative assays to experimentally test the designed proteins. A computational-experimental feedback loop will supercharge the search through sequence space equivalent to many millions of years of natural evolution to discover novel synthetic proteins with unprecedented control over functional properties.

[Matt Gee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewgee1/), Center for Data Science and Public Policy

Trends in automation and the digital reorganization of work pose challenges for those seeking to make strategic skilling and hiring decisions. Existing scholarship offers limited guidance for these decisions as it tends to model sectors of the knowledge economy as modules, rather than parts of a connected, adaptive system. This project will leverage unprecedented access to the complete LinkedIn dataset to identify mixtures of knowledge, skills, and relationships that maximize income and future potential for individual participants in the knowledge economy. Coupled with enterprise and regional data, the researchers will perform natural experiments to evaluate predictions about marginal skill development and optimal skill sourcing to yield a wealth of intellectual, technological, and commercial innovations that will have a direct and positive impact on society.

This study will apply the technique of unsupervised feature clustering to identify and model patient clinical behaviors from their electronic health records. The project will allow medical providers to understand groups and patterns in patient clinical behavior, identify fundamental factors contributing to adverse medical events such as death and cardiac arrest, and even discover unknown clinical behaviors.

[Brian Nord](http://computing.fnal.gov/brian-nord/), Fermilab

Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are currently making significant technical progress, with commensurate interest from the public, media outlets, funding agencies, and corporate partners. Stakeholders frequently point to the potential of these technologies to “transform society,” but what does this mean, practically? Should we, as researchers, anticipate the social, political, and ethical consequences of our work and steer our research programs accordingly? Can we draw from scholarship in the social sciences and the humanities to inform understanding of the distributional impacts our programs? This workshop will explore these questions and develop collaborations across disciplines, institutions, and key stakeholders who may be able to help responsibly steer the evolution of these revolutionary technologies in ethical and socially beneficial ways.

# CDAC Summer Lab Videos Display Student Research and Creativity

Watch project videos from the high school and undergraduate students of the 2020 CDAC Data & Computing Summer Lab, covering research in machine learning, theoretical computer science, natural language processing, computer vision, and more.

Today’s younger generations have grown up immersed in a world of data and computing. So naturally, these students are eager to learn the skills to work with these technologies, applying the tools of computer and data science to build a better future for all.

That technological upbringing also allowed the 37 high school and undergraduate students of the [CDAC Data & Computing Summer Lab](/engage/summerlab/) to adapt when the second year of the program switched to remote due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of gathering on the University of Chicago campus, students gathered in virtual meetings to work with their faculty mentors on research projects, hear talks from leading scientists, and form an international community with one another. Through their patience and persistence and the hard work of Summer Lab staff and mentors, a difficult and socially distant summer was transformed into a valuable learning experience for students just beginning their research careers. 

The students’ talent and creativity is on full display in their final videos — short presentations that summarized their research accomplishments over the 10-week program. These [3-to-5-minute videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh) reflect the breadth of the Summer Lab research topics, from machine learning, theoretical computer science, natural language processing, and computer vision to high-energy physics, genetics, and the social sciences. In many cases, the short duration of the program was nevertheless enough for students to complete publication-quality work.

“The CDAC Summer Lab was a great experience for me to have exposure to the applications of computer science in other domains and gain technical knowledge,” said Aarthi Koripelly, an incoming University of Chicago student and Summer Lab Research Assistant in both 2019 and 2020, whose work was nominated for Best Undergraduate Poster awards at the [Supercomputing 2020](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/) conference. “My projects have helped me hone my research and communication skills in writing reports, presenting to others, and submitting to a conference, which would not have been possible without the opportunities CDAC has provided.” 

**Machine Learning**

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence drive many technological innovations today, and several CDAC students spent their summer studying how to improve the accuracy and performance of these algorithms. But importantly, they also studied how to make machine learning approaches more fair, and more “human.” Ray Fregly examined how to utilize ML to help researchers understand [how children acquire language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNtGswLdPlg&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=24) by listening to their parents. [Christine Jacinto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xnjjbXxWPY&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=8) and [Daniel Serrano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OMLVwEtY7I&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=29) each studied methods for improving the fairness and reducing bias in how ML is applied to real-world situations. And Jamar Sullivan worked on [integrating human feedback into ML processes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PN-oKBYCKQ&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=16), improving how models are trained to extract important features from text or photographs.

**Security and Misinformation**

The dark side of technology is how it can offer opportunities for malicious actors to access or manipulate data, with harmful effects. Summer Lab projects examined many dimensions of these threats, including the use of ML to [detect anomalous network activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeUa_9QlaFA&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=20) (Lia Troy), a tool for cloaking photos to interfere with non-consent facial recognition tools ([Jiawen Shen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyoS778MsbE&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=18)), and strategies for combating the spread of misinformation on social media sites such as WhatsApp ([Jason Chee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHj9Sklciw&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=17)) and [Twitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTkIkJJ4FdU&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=26). 

To produce tech safety guidelines for people participating in Black Lives Matters protests, [Maia Boyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eglzkgt4kiQ&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=30) combined online advice articles and a survey of protestors. [Julio Ramirez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmQ4I9MsXAA&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=19) and [Nikki Chakravarthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKD92N-epCo&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=22) utilized data from the [CDAC Internet of Things Lab](/iot-lab/) and their own home installations to study the vulnerabilities of smart home devices such as speakers, lights, and appliances.

**Data Science**

Almost every day brings new tools and methods for capturing knowledge from data, from text and time series to images and video. Summer Lab researchers worked with UChicago projects such as [Chameleon](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/), [Globus](http://globus.org), [funcX](https://funcx.org/), and [GeoDa](https://geodacenter.github.io/), finding new ways of [processing data in the cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYtYqXGCe7U&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=2) (Akhil Kodumuri), using [best practices for spatial data research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYn_AgHiauM&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=23) (R.E. Stern), making scientific projects more easily [expandable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuxdTLe6840&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=5) and [reproducible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOLpNBurQD4&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=13) (Avery Schwartz and Isabel Brunkan), and [optimizing databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPmuSZtiiiQ&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=25) for research and discovery (Ryan Wong). Projects also developed strategies for automatically extracting information from large pools of scientific journal text, using [dependency parsers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejGuCVjotuU&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=1) or [clustering methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9sqWaTqGvM&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=7) (Aarthi Koripellly and Chimaobi Amanchukwu).

**Applications and Education**

All of these data and computing approaches are no longer confined to the field of computer science, as they have crossed over to help researchers in myriad fields of inquiry. In the physical sciences, [Yair Atlas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdBBH50zkW8&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=28) and [Ishan Malhotra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58nWb3rZKks&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=15) built and tested algorithms for a “self-driving” telescope that automatically directs cosmic surveys towards interesting astronomical phenomena, while Chinmaya Mahesh (with some pretty impressive accent work) [created ML-driven triggers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBpBJQQ_VWQ&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=27) for spotting and saving potential discoveries within data from the Large Hadron Collider. In a project appropriate for the remote summer, Melissa Tovar helped [adapt the Scratch Encore curriculum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBnYq-Khdko&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=21) for early-age computer science education to the online learning environments many students are using this fall.

Other students created pipelines for studying the [genetics of breast cancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8cpWbxUAGs&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=4) (Arvind Krishnan), [neighborhood segregation in Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZWH-f3-d4&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=10) (Felix Farb), [ancient cuneiform tablets from the Middle East](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe-F3YADM4A&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=11) (Grace Su), or [scraping PDFs to study access to medications for opioid use disorder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKwuZ5PpXVA&list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh&index=31) (Olina Liang).

You can watch videos from almost all of the CDAC Data & Computing Summer Lab projects in [our YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0IrIAIuK93E7cbGQFuGn8NWltNYDwxMh); more will be added as results are published.

# Danny Ng’s Path to Becoming a TA in UChicago’s Applied Data Science Program

![Danny Ng](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/danny_ng.jpg)

[Image: Danny Ng]

For Danny Ng, the journey into data science and teaching was less about following a direct path and more about seizing opportunities as they arose. A PhD graduate in statistics from the University of Chicago, Ng’s connection to the [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) (formerly MSCA) program is a bit different from most of the program’s teaching assistants. While many TAs come from the program itself, Ng’s connection stemmed from his time in the Department of Statistics, where he had already established himself as a teacher and researcher.

#### **From PhD to teaching assistant**

Ng’s journey into teaching for the MS in Applied Data Science program began towards the end of his PhD at UChicago. “I had teaching experience already—I was a TA during my undergrad and throughout my PhD years. As part of the PhD in statistics, we had to teach one class,” he explains. “When I was finishing my PhD, people in the MSCA program asked me if I’d like to be a TA. I think they liked the way I explained things, and that’s how I got started.”

At the time, the program had just started, and Ng saw an opportunity to help shape the future of the data science field by teaching in an emerging program. He was one of the first TAs in the MSCA program, which would later become the MS in Applied Data Science program.

#### **Ng’s perspective on teaching data science**

Ng’s role as a TA for the program has evolved over the years. He’s taught a wide range of courses, including machine learning and advanced machine learning. For Ng, the greatest reward comes from the diverse student body he interacts with. “What’s different about a professional program like this is the level of motivation,” he explains. “Students come in knowing exactly what they want, and they’re eager to learn because they’re paying for it. It’s not like undergrads who sit in class just to fulfill a requirement—they’re here to maximize their learning.”

The students in the program come from all walks of life—some straight out of undergrad, others from industry looking to switch careers or deepen their expertise. This diversity in background and experience is one of the most enriching aspects of the program, and it’s something Ng sees improving with each passing year. “The students are getting stronger. A few years ago, we had a lot of boot camp graduates, but now students come in with better programming skills and a solid foundation in machine learning,” he notes. This higher level of preparedness makes the program more dynamic and rewarding for everyone involved.

#### **Teaching practical applications of data science**

When it comes to the skills and concepts Ng hopes students take away from his courses, he emphasizes the importance of asking, “When should I use this technique, and when should I not?” While many traditional academic programs focus on teaching students how to use various tools and techniques, Ng encourages his students to think critically about how to apply them in the real world. “In professional programs like ours, we focus on application. We ask students to consider when a technique is applicable and when it might not be,” he explains. “It’s not just about knowing how to use a model; it’s about understanding when it’s the right choice.”

This real-world focus, combined with the program’s strong academic foundation, helps students bridge the gap between theory and practice, preparing them to apply their knowledge in a variety of industries.

#### **Evolving with the field**

Being a TA doesn’t just help Ng stay connected to the world of data science—it also keeps him sharp. “Teaching helps me stay updated on the latest changes in the field, whether it’s new machine learning techniques, changes in programming languages, or even the newest developments in cloud computing,” he says. Teaching forces him to stay current with evolving technologies, something he sees as an essential part of his own professional growth.

Additionally, Ng finds that teaching helps improve his own communication skills. “It’s one thing to know a topic, but it’s another thing to explain it clearly to someone else,” he says. “Being able to address students’ questions and communicate complex ideas effectively has been invaluable, especially when working with stakeholders at all levels in my job.”

#### **Advice for prospective students**

As someone who has worked with a range of students in the MS in Applied Data Science program, Ng has some advice for prospective students. “The most successful students tend to be highly technical,” he notes. “You need a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and critical thinking. If you’re an undergrad considering this program, focus on building those foundational skills. The program moves quickly, and you’ll need that background to succeed.”

Ng also emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and adapting, “The field of data science is constantly changing. Staying up to date is crucial not just for the students, but also for those of us teaching the next generation of data scientists.”

#### **A lasting impact**

Ng’s story highlights the power of teaching and the personal growth that comes with it. Though he never completed the MS in Applied Data Science program himself, his deep connection to UChicago’s data science community as a teacher has allowed him to make a lasting impact on students and the field of data science. His perspective on the program, and the evolving nature of its students, shows just how much it has grown since its early days.

# Data-Driven Solutions for Complex Social Issues: DSI’s Community Data Fellows Program

Leveraging data science to address cross-sector challenges

The Community Data Fellows program is a core piece of the Data Science Institute’s community-centered data science. The Institute is dedicated to assisting community-based organizations in fulfilling their data needs and expanding their reach and impact. The Community Data Fellows program operates in collaboration with civic organizations on global, national, and local levels, committed to tackling cross-sector challenges together.

In Spring 2023, we joined government departments and community organizations serving diverse communities and focused on equity, education, healthcare, environment, youth development, and poverty. Through this program, these community-based organizations gained access to the resources and knowledge they needed to leverage their data and make informed decisions for driving positive change.

The Community Data Fellows program, which recruits new fellows every quarter, offers  students the opportunity to apply their classroom knowledge to real-world projects. Duration of projects ranges from a few weeks to months, depending on the project’s scope. The Community Data program’s goal is to establish mutually-beneficial relationships with a network of community partners for long-term collaboration. Spring 2023 Fellows worked closely with organizations like the International Rescue Committee, the Chicago Public Library, the State of Illinois Office of Equity & Inclusion, and local Chicago non-profits including Southside Blooms and Plan4Success. Students were empowered to manage the consulting engagement from start to finish, which involved scoping the project, developing tools and mechanisms tailored to the client’s needs, receiving regular feedback, and delivering a sustainable and effective final product. Our Community Data projects provide fellows with hands-on experience, helping them hone their skills and gain expertise in consulting and collaborating with a community service lens.

The Community Data Fellows program is a crucial part of the Data Science Institute’s mission to drive social impact and advance data-driven solutions. By participating in the program, students gain an understanding of how data can be leveraged to create sustainable social impact and develop the skills necessary to make meaningful contributions to society.

# Data Science Clinic students solve real-world problems, gain lifelong skills

One hundred and thirty-five University of Chicago graduate and undergraduate students participated in the Data Science Institute’s [Data Science Clinic](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/data-science-clinic/) across three quarters this year. The clinic pairs teams of students with a real-world client to work on a data science problem.

This year’s clients came from the nonprofit, civic, academic, and industry sectors. Groups of two to five students were assigned to one of 31 projects and tasked with producing several key deliverables, such as data analysis or open-source software, as well as final client presentations and research reports.

Each team receives guidance from a mentor, frequently a postdoctoral researcher, and a master’s student who serves as a teaching assistant. Once assigned a project, the teams self-organize, developing their own meeting schedules, distributing tasks, and communicating about progress and challenges both internally and externally to the client.

“The goal of the clinic is to expose students to the variability of real-world projects,” said [Nicholas Ross](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/nick-ross/), director of the Data Science Clinic and an associate senior instructional professor at the Data Science Institute. “Students learn how to adapt and pivot as their projects proceed, trying new things until a workable solution develops. Through this process, participants also develop leadership and communications skills as they work with individuals with varied backgrounds and skillsets. They also learn internal accountability.”

**A project for every interest**

Projects this year ran the gamut from predictive modeling to machine learning and data analysis to data management systems.

One group, for instance, worked with American Family Insurance to estimate storm and weather risks for homeowners across the country. The team used historical records to develop a series of charts and visualizations that show the relative risks of severe weather events in different areas of the country. The company can use these new tools to better advise its customers on how to protect against potential weather damage and save money.

Another team partnered with Invenergy, a Chicago-based international renewable energy provider, to improve the process for identifying damage to the company’s wind turbines. The company uses drones to monitor their turbines, resulting in thousands of images to review for damage daily. The students developed algorithms that allowed Invenergy to more quickly review images and more accurately identify potential damage, saving the company time and money.

Ning Tang, MS ’23, worked on a project with a well-known regional bank to predict non-maturing deposit balances. The project provided an invaluable opportunity to employ the practical application of machine learning methods to real-world problem-solving, she said.

“Collaborating with the bank’s team of data scientists provided us with valuable insights gained through their practical experience,” she said. “I would highly recommend this course to others, especially for those who aspire to work in the industry after graduation. It offers an excellent opportunity to engage with external clients, establish valuable connections, and gain hands-on experience in solving real-world challenges.”

**Recognizing excellence in mentoring**

New this year, the clinic presented the Data Science Clinic Excellence in Mentoring Award to recognize the important role that mentors play in the program.

The annual award, presented during the Spring Quarter, recognizes individuals who have demonstrated extraordinary commitment to fostering the intellectual, creative, scholarly, and professional development of their mentees.

“A lot of the success or failure of a project depends on the investment that a mentor puts into it,” Ross said about the impetus behind the award. “Rewarding and recognizing mentors that go above and beyond the call of duty is one way to thank them and to ensure the value of the program going forward.”

This year’s winners were postdoctoral scholars [Patricia Chiril](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/patricia-chiril/) (left) and [Anna Woodard](http://cs.uchicago.edu/people/anna-woodard/) (right).

!    !

“Both Patricia and Anna made a significant impact on the clinic this year,” said Ross. “Anna has provided an incredible amount of useful feedback on how the clinic as a whole can be better. That’s in addition to the fact that the students love working with her.

“Patricia, who focuses on Natural Language Processing, has a very in-demand specialization. She not only mentored her own projects, but also was always willing to jump in to help with other projects and provide them with guidance and feedback.

“The clinic would not have been as successful as it was this year without their efforts,” Ross said. “We applaud and thank them for the extraordinary job that they have done – and appreciate the hard work of all of our mentors and teaching assistants this year.”

Compostable and bioplastic packaging has been on a steady upward growth trend worldwide, gaining speed in recent years. However, issues exist around compostability certifications based on lab testing alone not proving sufficient to earn widespread facility acceptance. This can result in “compostable” products that do not disintegrate under the conditions specific to all composting facilities. In-field testing for product disintegration is one attempt to bridge this gap.

The [Compostable Field Testing Program](https://www.compostfoundation.org/FieldTesting) (CFTP) is an international, open-source research platform for composters to field-test compostable foodware and packaging. Operating since 2016, CFTP has collected data from field trials conducted at multiple compost facilities with varying processing technologies, scale, and geography.

DSI and CFTP, with support from the [11th Hour Project](https://11thhourproject.org/), are now analyzing disintegration and facility data which represents more than 30,000 units of packaging, 82 different types of individual fiber and compostable plastic packaging and products, and 18 diverse composting facilities to date. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that is useful for a wide audience, including composters and packaging producers, food service establishments, policymakers, and the public.

During the 2024 winter semester, DSI clinic students worked with the CFTP to translate data into easily digestible results for use in an in-person presentation. In addition to providing visual interpretations of the data, the students provided feedback and input on the nature of the data and the best ways to communicate it meaningfully for a broad audience. Visualizations the students created were showcased at [US Composting Council](https://www.compostingcouncil.org/)’s 34th annual conference, COMPOST2024, in Daytona, Florida, in the first-ever public sharing of the CFTP’s field test results.

The presenters covered the program’s background and the case for open-source data sharing. Most importantly, they shared the preliminary results of field testing the disintegration of compostable items across a range of facilities and a mockup of the public results database to be launched later in 2024.

“We are all aware of the challenges that plastic waste presents to our environment,” said Data Scientist Mentor Todd Nief. “We are thrilled to contribute to the CFTP’s mission to make composting field results more transparent.”

This quarter, Chicago high school students have dedicated part of their Saturdays to come to the University of Chicago campus and learn the basics of data science. The [Data4All program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/engage/data4all/) — co-organized by the DSI, Argonne National Laboratory, the UChicago Office of Civic Engagement, and the Center for Spatial Data Science — bridges the gap between introductory computer science courses and the data science research lifecycle, teaching students how to work with real data and the careers available to them in technical fields.

Two of this fall’s students, Skylar Spratt and Surrey Jones of Kenwood Academy, featured in a news article by the [*Hyde Park Herald*](https://www.hpherald.com/evening_digest/kenwood-academys-partnership-with-argonne-prompts-visit-with-secretary-of-energy/article_715d1f96-6478-11ed-b063-7fb0ddfc2cb1.html?utm_source=hpherald.com&utm_campaign=%2Fnewsletters%2Flists%2Fevening-digest%2F%3F-dc%3D1668474015&utm_medium=email&utm_content=image) about the partnerships between Argonne and Kenwood, a South Side high school serving over 2300 students. The article highlights the school’s effort to expand their STEM programs, and recaps a November 4th visit to Kenwood by U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.

*Surrey Jones, another Kenwood student in Data4All, talked about a newer project about the way COVID-19 has affected different parts of Chicago and how whether or not people have health insurance affected them during the pandemic.*

*“In different communities, they have different resources that others don’t,” Jones said. “The West Side might not have the same amount of resources that the South Side has, so there would be a lot more cases on the West Side because they don’t have those resources.”*

*Jones said Data4All has strongly affected her career interests, in terms of exposure to different kinds of engineering and the way new technologies are changing the world.*

*“I really didn’t think that data was a big deal. I did not think it was as big as it is, so this has definitely helped me,” she said. “And it’s actually pretty fun exploring. It gives you a lot more knowledge as to what’s happening in the world.”*

# DSI Celebrates Culmination of 2024 Summer Programs

!

Members of the Data Science Institute’s 2024 Summer Programs

For eight weeks this summer, 36 students from across the country engaged in intensive research projects, deepening their understanding of data science applications across various disciplines. Ranging from high school to undergraduate upperclassmen, the UChicago Data Science Institute’s summer program students embarked on an intellectual journey filled with personal and professional growth. The students brought a diversity of experiences, academic backgrounds, and research interests to their projects. Majoring in physics, political science, chemical engineering, computer science, robotics, mathematics, and more,  students came together to advance data science research. This brought about unique opportunities to broaden their technical skills, learn about new fields of study, and explore their scholastic and career options in new ways. 

Students participating in the **Summer Lab** were paired with faculty mentors across the university. The program is designed to provide high school and undergraduate students with hands-on experience in data science research, fostering their skills in computational analysis, data management, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Participants engage in cutting-edge projects that address real-world problems, working closely with their faculty mentors and peers. 21 students took on wide-ranging projects, with examples including neutrino research, programming robots that teach social and emotional learning to children, and identifying climate infrastructure in Chicago. One of the most important aspects of Summer Lab is the cohort structure. Dr. [Kyle Chard](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/kyle-chard/), Summer Lab program director and Research Associate Professor, said that “the cohort environment is integral to the Summer Lab program — it fosters a collaborative environment where students learn from one another and builds strong camaraderie that supports students through the challenges and successes of research.”

Learning alongside the Summer Lab students, participants in the Data Science for Social Impact (DSSI) summer program focused on natural language processing research projects to benefit external partners in social impact organizations spanning climate, health, policy, human rights, and finance. Partners for this year’s research projects were sourced among our [11th Hour Project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/11th-hour-project/) partners, including [BankTrack](https://www.banktrack.org/page/about_banktrack), the [Center for Good Food Purchasing](https://goodfoodpurchasing.org/about-the-center/#what-we-do), and the [mBio Project](https://mbioproject.org/about). The **DSSI** program welcomes students from UChicago and a consortium of diverse higher education partners, including historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), minority-serving institutions (MSIs), and Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), The consortium is a collaborative effort to broaden participation in the talent pipeline, serve communities of highest need, and introduce students to social impact data science career opportunities. This year, fifteen students from seven colleges and universities across the nation joined the DSSI program. The institutions included North Carolina State University; Howard University; City Colleges of Chicago; California State University; the University of Chicago; the University of Texas at San Antonio; and the University of Illinois Chicago. Over the 8-week program, students engaged with rigorous curriculum and technical training to perform analysis and produce project-specific deliverables. 

Participants in both summer programs engaged in several professional development activities, including a weekly speaker series featuring UChicago faculty, program alumni, and industry representatives; career seminars; and public speaking workshops. Additionally, students enjoyed various social activities, including a tour focused on the history of Bronzeville, a White Sox game, and a volunteer activity with the Chicago Park District. 

While troubleshooting code and problem-solving with analytical techniques, participants found time for communal fun amidst their hard work, forming career-long friendships. “I believe the students were able to grow their professional network while participating in the summer programs, as well as make significant additions to their resume that could help them in their future professional pursuits,” said Satadisha Saha Bhowmick, Research Lead of the DSSI program.

A few projects from the DSI’s Summer Programs are highlighted below:

#### **Implementing Large Language Models From Farm to Fork**

!

The [Center for Good Food Purchasing](https://goodfoodpurchasing.org) reviews receipts and invoices to track the kind of foods that public institutions typically purchase. The Center staff categorizes food items and rates them on factors like sustainability, worker treatment, and animal welfare. Institutions can then review these ratings when making future purchasing decisions. Using different methods of natural language processing, students worked to automate this food labeling task. 

Yannick Tanyi (UChicago), Joanna John (North Carolina State University), and Atuwatse Okorodudu (Howard University) took on this task using prompt generation. The team employed different prompting methods to train their large language models in classifying food products, such as zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation. They also utilized Llama3 and OpenAI GPT models to compare cost-effectiveness and performance. While students observed that the use of OpenAI GPT provided higher accuracy in grouping food products, RAG implementation greatly increased the performance of the Llama3 model. Engagement in this project helped to inform students’ academic and career goals. “It was really beneficial to be able to understand how to incorporate my Political Science lens through a technology field and how I could work on social impact projects where I could incorporate the best of both worlds,” said Atuwatse Okorodudu.

#### **Extracting Financial Information for Fiscal and Social Accountability**

!

Zaina Khalil discussing her team’s research for BankTrack

[BankTrack](https://www.banktrack.org) is an international tracking, campaigning, and civil society support organization targeting private-sector commercial banks and the activities they finance. BankTrack combines twenty years of critical yet constructive engagement with banks and banking initiatives. Form 8-K is a required report that companies must file with the SEC to announce major events that shareholders should know about, such as incurring debt. Using data from these forms, BankTrack aims to illuminate pertinent information regarding the monetary expenditures of financial institutions and the corresponding ramifications in order to inform the public.

Jonathan Garcia (California State University, Fresno), Diego Sarria (North Carolina State University), Zaina Khalil (University of Illinois Chicago), and Jack Sanderson (UChicago) worked together to distill complex text in approximately 100 8-K forms into informative summaries. The team constructed the training label summaries through heuristically-generated summaries and the labels and text were then used to train Long Encoder Decoder (LED) and LLaMa large language models (LLMs). After training, refining, and adjusting parameters for these models, the group found that both models were able to create summaries that were much more brief than the original text while retaining approximately 90% of the necessary information. The students overcame different hurdles in order to utilize models that efficiently summarize dense financial documents. While discussing challenging aspects of the research project, rising sophomore Zaina Khalil said “I never worked with natural language processing before so it was definitely a learning curve developing models and getting acclimated to Github, but the project allowed me to gain a new skill set and learn how to work with a team to make progress.”

#### **Socially Fair Regionalization**

Yassir Atlas (University of Illinois at Chicago) was mentored by Dr. Yue Lin at the UChicago Center for Spatial Data Science. For his Summer Lab project, he studied regionalization algorithms, which are used to group areas into continuous regions for school districting, political districting, habitat delineation, etc. Regionalization algorithms inform major societal decisions, so it is important to ensure they are socially fair. Yassir’s Summer Lab research showed that commonly used regionalization algorithms can favor certain racial subgroups. He also proposed a solution to this problem that minimizes the maximum subgroup cost.

Learn more about Yassir’s project in the below video presentation.

#### **Navigating the Wild: Classifying and Detecting Animals in Low-Quality Camera Trap Image**

For her Summer Lab project, Elva Lu (University of California, Berkeley) worked with Dr. Kyle Chard and his PhD student Matt Baughman. Camera traps are used to monitor wildlife and have important conservation uses, but the images they capture are often low-quality and difficult for computer image models to analyze. Elva developed an efficient approach to improving the detection and classification of animals in these low-quality camera trap images. She utilized a combination of existing computer vision models and pre-processing techniques to enhance image quality, achieving a significant increase in detection accuracy. By integrating the CLIP vision-language model for zero-shot classification, Elva and her mentors were able to further refine accuracy without the need for extensive manual labeling. The results, developed and tested with data from Wellington, New Zealand, show promise for aiding conservation efforts by making the analysis of camera trap images more efficient and reliable. Elva said, “DSI Summer Lab gave me the opportunity to learn more about object detection models, develop solutions to address challenges of working with low-quality images, and explore my interest in vision-language models. I also enjoyed presenting my findings to different audiences and collaborating with my mentors.”

Learn more about Elva’s project in the below video presentation.

##### Project Title: Poultry Packaging Consolidation

Students:

Colin McLuckie – BA Data Science

Stella Chen – BA Data Science

Aiwen Xiao – MA Computational Social Science

Yijin Bao – MA Public Policy

The RAFI team, supported by the 11th Hour Project, was focused on understanding the role of livestock auction houses on setting prices for smaller farmers and large conglomerate operations. They found that as the number of auction houses has decreased, so have prices for poultry. With medium and smaller auction houses closing their doors, large poultry conglomerates have been able to keep prices lower, which benefits these larger corporations over small farm operations.

##### Project Title: AI to recognize stormwater detention features

Students:

Spencer Ellis – MS Computer Science

Tamami Tamura – BA Data Science

Matthew Rubenstein – BA Data Science

Stormwater infrastructure, such as permeable pavement, preserved wetlands, and storm drains, are vital for mitigating potential flooding in cities. However, there is no standard inventory for understanding what amount of an area is preserved for stormwater mitigation. This team of students created and tuned a model, using machine learning, to predict which regions of land on a map are preserved wetlands and ponds. Next steps will be to identify less obvious types of stormwater infrastructure.

##### Project Title: Generative AI Models for housing images

Students:

Grace Wang – BS Computer Science

DB Christenson – BA Data Science

Leon Wang – BA Data Science

Olesia Khrapunova – MS Computer Science

Machine-learning based computer vision relies on having a large data set of training images, ideally with balanced numbers of stimuli in each category. This group of students focused on how to generate fake images to create more balanced categories within a data set. Using pictures of building facades, the students trained an image generation model to produce synthetic images. They then tested these new images, mixed with existing stimuli, on a classifier and found that adding synthetic data to impoverished categories improved the classifier’s accuracy.

##### Project Title: Operational requirement management using graph based knowledge networks

Students:

Jason Yu – BA Data Science

Maya Ghosal – BA Computer Science and Data Science

Vincent Chirio – BA Data Science

Andrew Ellis Brander – BA Data Science

Within a large organization like Argonne National Laboratory, there can be a confusing number of policies and written guidance, not all of which is updated regularly. The students on this project attempted to use artificial intelligence (AI) to sift through documentation and find the correct policies. They created a pipeline to pull important information and trained a large language model (LLM) to provide responses based on this documentation. They hope that further work on this LLM will lead to the creation of a tool for Argonne employees to easily find the policies and regulations relevant to their queries.

In addition to recognizing students’ work, Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow [Peter Lu](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/peter-lu/) was selected as Mentor of the Year.

Reflecting on the year, Ross said, “Their collaborative efforts have spanned across industry, academia, non-profits, research labs, and mission-driven organizations, producing high-quality work that has set a new standard. This surge in interest reflects a broader trend: a generation of students passionate about leveraging data science to tackle real-world challenges and making a significant impact.”

# DSI Summer Lab Returns In-Person With 49 Students From Across the U.S.

After two years of remote participation, the 2022 [DSI Summer Lab](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/engage/summerlab/) will bring 49 high school, undergraduate, and master’s [students](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/engage/summerlab/#project-profiles) to Chicago for a ten-week immersion into data science research. The first in-person Summer Lab since 2019 features an expanded Social Impact Track, partnerships with the data.org [Capacity Accelerator Network](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/dsi-part-of-46m-grant-to-dataorg-capacity-accelerator-network/) and organizations from the [11th Hour Project](https://11thhourproject.org/), and over two dozen research mentors from the University of Chicago and its affiliated national laboratories.

!The eleventh edition of the Summer Lab program is the first under the umbrella of the Data Science Institute, after its previous homes in the Computation Institute and the Center for Data and Computing. Its format pairs students with a faculty mentor or non-profit organization to work on a research project applying data science across a variety of domains, including computer science, political science, climate and energy policy, public policy, materials science, computational psychology, biomedical research, and more.

“These students receive both an introduction to data science and its methods but also real research experience on ongoing projects,” said [David Uminsky](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/david-uminsky/), DSI executive director. “Many Summer Lab alumni have co-authored papers for major conferences, won awards, and some have subsequently enrolled at the University of Chicago for both undergraduate and graduate programs. I look forward to seeing the energy that this next generation of data scientists brings to the UChicago campus this summer.”

Since its origin, the Summer Lab program has acted on its commitment to broadening participation in data science by recruiting and welcoming students from all backgrounds. The 2022 cohort includes over half women and non-binary students, as well as a racial and ethnically diverse pool of students from around the United States.

“We strive to provide as many opportunities for as many excellent students as we can,” said Katherine Rosengarten, DSI Program Manager and co-leader of the Summer Lab with Uminsky and [Kyle Chard](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/kyle-chard/), Research Associate Professor in the UChicago Department of Computer Science. “The potential impact this program can have on each student’s future is exponential and very individualized to each student’s goals. Through this program, we hope that students learn more about all the various career paths they can have, build tools to help them achieve their goals, and find a community of fellow students, researchers, and faculty who will help them on that journey.”

For the first time this year, Summer Lab will also partner with the data science education network, a coalition led by the DSI and funded by data.org that brings together minority-serving institutions to build a modular, experiential data science curriculum geared toward financial inclusion. Seven students from those partner institutions will come to UChicago for this year’s program.

“The network puts us in direct partnership with schools that have budding or existing data science programs, and allows us to create a direct pipeline for their students to the Summer Lab program, thereby expanding opportunities and potential impact,” Rosengarten said.

The program will also welcome 12 students from nine Chicago-area and California high schools, 23 undergraduates from nine universities, and 14 UChicago master’s students from the Computer Science, Computational Analysis and Public Policy, and Computational Social Science programs. They will work with 29 [mentors](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/mentors/) from 13 different units, including Argonne National Laboratory, Fermilab, the Harris School of Public Policy, the Center for Spatial Data Science, and UChicago Departments of Computer Science, Psychology, Political Science, and Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Students will work on scientific subjects ranging from cosmic surveys and neutrino detection to linguistics and medical imaging to machine learning and robotics. A number of projects will also come from DSI research initiatives on [Internet Equity](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/) and [Data & Democracy](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/data-democracy-initiative/), and the DSI partnership with the 11th Hour Project, an arm of The Schmidt Family Foundation that serves nonprofits in energy, food and agriculture, human rights, and marine technology. The Summer Lab Social Impact Track, which debuted last year, will feature projects with 11th Hour organizations [Inclusive Development International,](https://www.inclusivedevelopment.net/) mBio, [Remora Fishing Traceability](https://www.remoraxyz.com/), the [Schmidt Ocean Institute](https://schmidtocean.org/), and [WoMin African Alliance](https://womin.africa/), as well as local non-profit [BPI Chicago](https://www.bpichicago.org/).

“Our social impact partners are very excited to work with students full time, to be a part of a longer summer program where they have more time to engage with the students,” said Daniel Grzenda, staff data scientist at DSI and leader of the Social Impact Track. “The projects we work on are more research-focused, and they’re larger impact projects rather than just one-off pieces of software.”

Summer Lab will make its home in the John Crerar Library Building, sharing space with the [Computer Science Instructional Laboratory](https://csil.cs.uchicago.edu/) (CSIL), the UChicago Library’s [GIS Hub](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/spaces/crerar-library-gis-hub/), and the [Media Arts, Data, and Design Center](https://arts.uchicago.edu/explore/initiatives/media-arts-data-and-design-center-madd-center). Social events will include game nights with the [Weston Game Lab](https://arts.uchicago.edu/explore/initiatives/media-arts-data-and-design-center-madd-center/weston-game-lab), field trips to Argonne National Laboratory and the Museum of Science and Industry, and other exciting Chicago activities. With the return to an in-person program, the organizers anticipate that the students will form even stronger relationships that last far beyond the summer.

“I always say to the students that they learn more from each other than they do from us,” Chard said. “I think having those random ad hoc meetings in a room where they can learn from each other and get a much broader range in terms of experience with different projects will make the cohort-building side of the summer so much stronger than in the virtual environment of the last two years.”

Attendees at August’s DSI Summer Lab Symposium might be surprised to learn that many of the poised young scientists presenting their research were brand-new to their areas of study. They began working on their summer projects just ten weeks before. Students presented work on a variety of topics, from agricultural consolidation to robotics in 3D printing, breast cancer imaging, simulated chemical reactions, and more. The diversity of the topics studied during Summer Lab showcased the students’ hard work and adaptability, the impressive breadth of data science research at UChicago, and the importance of education in data science for students with wide-ranging interests.

Over the course of the summer, the nine high schoolers and thirteen undergraduates that made up the 2023 cohort conducted research alongside members of the UChicago faculty. Students hailed from schools from across the country. They were assigned to their mentors based on shared subject interests and technical competency, but many students had little research experience, especially in their specific research area. Over a short period of time, they gained expertise in their research topics. At the August symposium, they presented recorded talks and posters, but the work didn’t end there. Ongoing research products include interactive dashboards, paper co-authorships, upcoming conference presentations, and even potential policy change through collaborations with nonprofits. 

Approximately half of this year’s Summer Lab participants had never done research before, and many shared that this experience increased their interest in research and helped them to refine their future career goals. Students also learned new technical skills during the course of their projects, including the programming language Python and packages like NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, and more.

Although the students worked hard on their individual research projects, they also found time to connect as a cohort through bowling, a White Sox game, volunteering with the Chicago Park District, a picnic, an ice cream social, and, of course, troubleshooting code. Said Summer Lab program director and Research Associate Professor Dr. Kyle Chard, “Data science research is not a solitary endeavor, and it’s important for these students to learn how to connect, work together, and learn from one another.” 

A few [Summer Lab projects](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/alumni-and-projects/) are featured below.

### Self-Driving Telescopes: Changing the game for astronomical observation scheduling

Shohini Sarkar, a high schooler from Fremont, California, worked with Dr. Brian Nord of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Her project leveraged reinforcement learning to help efficiently position high-powered telescopes. She shared, “I was definitely interested in reinforcement learning so getting to work on that was a big plus! However, the astrophysics stuff was entirely new to me, and it has opened my eyes to all the ways that AI can be used in the field of astrophysics.” Sarkar’s work contributed to a workshop paper and will be included in future paper submissions. In addition, there are plans to implement her algorithms at telescope observatories and distribute software based on her code. 

### Consolidation in the Poultry Packing Industry

Undergraduate students Steven Chacón (University of Illinois at Chicago), Alena Zeng (UChicago), and Abigail Starr (UChicago) spent their summer working on a project in collaboration with the nonprofit [Rural Advancement Foundation International](https://www.rafiusa.org/) (RAFI). They were mentored by DSI researchers and software engineers Todd Nief, Launa Greer, and Trevor Spreadbury. They studied market capture and concentration within the poultry industry, a phenomenon that has been shown to hurt small farmers by allowing major corporations to hold disproportionate market power. By compiling data from satellite imagery, environmental studies, business records, and more, these Summer Lab students created an interactive dashboard that presents the extent of market concentration. Then, their partners at RAFI used the dashboard in advocacy meetings with congressional offices. Said Zeng, “Since I’m studying economics and data science, I liked that our project had an emphasis on understanding the agricultural industry and different market situations, which tied my classes to the real world. The project also showed me that I enjoy working on social impact-related projects, because our work felt really meaningful and produced tangible results used for policy.” Nief, one of the team’s mentors, added, “I was impressed with the students’ work ethic, their engagement with the details of the problem of corporate consolidation in meat-packing, and their willingness to be adaptable to the changing demands of deploying a real world application on a short deadline.”

### Fast Molecular Simulations with Minimal Effort

In his presentation, Alex Tuecke, a high schooler at Beacon Academy in Evanston, shared that traditional simulations of molecular dynamics are computationally expensive, often taking more than an hour to run. Alongside his mentor, Dr. Chard, Alex developed a machine learning model that can effectively simulate dehydration reactions in about two minutes. “I had no experience in either quantum chemistry or machine learning prior to my research,” said Alex. “Now, I am more interested in exploring the quantum field in college. This was my first research project, so I was not sure how it would go. I loved it, and it really solidified my plans to do CS in the future. I want to do something like this next summer.”

These projects and many more can be viewed on the [Summer Lab website](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/alumni-and-projects/).

# Eighteen UChicago faculty members receive named, distinguished service professorships in 2024

Including DSI's very own Bo Li and Ce Zhang

Eighteen University of Chicago faculty members have received distinguished service professorships or named professorships.

Profs. Omri Ben-Shahar, Michael Bourdaghs, Veronica Guerrieri, Guido Lorenzoni, Harold Pollack and Mauricio Tenorio have been named distinguished service professors. Profs. Adam Chilton, Yoonsun Choi, Henry Hoffmann, Hakan Karateke, Greg Kaplan, Derek Kennet, Bo Li, Joseph Masco, James T. Robinson, Emily Rogalski, Christopher Wild and Ce Zhang have received named professorships.

The appointments were effective Jan. 1, 2024, unless otherwise noted.

#### Division of Biological Sciences

**Emily Rogalski** has been named the first Rosalind Franklin PhD Professor in the Department of Neurology. Rogalski joined UChicago in 2023 to lead the new University of Chicago Healthy Aging & Alzheimer’s Research Care (HAARC) Center, which will bring together a wide range of scientists and health experts to accelerate breakthroughs in aging, dementia and cognitive resilience.

Rogalski is a clinical and cognitive neuroscientist, and her research uses a highly multidisciplinary approach to investigate two aging perspectives: primary progressive aphasia, in which neurodegenerative disease invades the language network, and “SuperAging,” in which individuals are seemingly resistant to the deleterious changes in memory associated with “normal” or more typical cognitive aging.

Her aphasia research focuses on characterizing the clinical and anatomical features of primary progressive aphasia, drivers of disease progression, identifying risk factors, and refining our understanding of language and network organization. She has also pioneered a line of care support research for individuals with dementia including the development of Communication Bridge, an intervention delivered via telemedicine focused on maximizing communication and quality of life for individuals with the condition and their care partners.

She operationalized the SuperAging phenotype and has helped to establish the unique biologic, molecular, genetic and psychosocial features associated with SuperAging. She leads an international study of SuperAgers that holds promise for identifying protective factors for avoiding Alzheimer’s disease, optimizing health span and reducing stigma and negative expectations associated with aging.

She is the recipient of several awards, including Crain’s Chicago Business ‘40 under 40’ and the Alzheimer’s Association Howie Dean Award.

#### Division of the Humanities

**Michael K. Bourdaghs** has been named the Robert S. Ingersoll Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations and the College.

As a scholar of modern Japanese literature, literary and critical theory and music, Bourdaghs focuses on moving beyond the boundaries of Japan across multiple global networks for his research. He believes these dialogues fundamentally shape the meanings of the nation’s culture, literature and music. In his book “[A Fictional Commons: Natsume Sōseki and the Properties of Modern Literature](https://www.dukeupress.edu/a-fictional-commons)” (2021), recipient of an honorable mention for the 2023 John Whitney Hall Prize from the Association of Asian Studies, Bourdaghs re-examines the fiction and critical essays of Sōseki as they relate to ideologies of modern property ownership.

In the realm of Japanese popular music from 1945 to the early 1990s, in “[Sayonara Amerika, Sayonara Nippon: A Geopolitical Pre-History of J-Pop](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/sayonara-amerika-sayonara-nippon/9780231158756)” (2012) he analyzes how songs performed by Kasagi Shizuko, Sakamoto Kyū and the Yellow Magic Orchestra engaged creatively with the shifting historical context of Japan’s Cold War. His current research project, for which Bourdaghs received a 2019 Guggenheim Fellowship, reconsiders Japanese culture during the Cold War era. Bourdaghs seeks to look beyond U.S./Japan bilateral relations to consider how Japanese writers, filmmakers and musicians participated in multiple Cold War networks. These include the First World of capitalist liberal democracies, the Second World of the socialist bloc and the Third World of the decolonization movement.

**Hakan Karateke** has been named the Kanuni Süleyman Professor in Ottoman and Modern Turkish Studies in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and the College.

A cultural historian of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, Karateke often explores the realms where philology and literary history intersect in his research. In “The Ottoman World: A Cultural History Reader. 1450–1700” (2021), co-authored with Helga Anetshofer at UChicago, Karateke shares a wide range of voices from Ottoman society for teachers and students, spanning many individuals and providing insights into everyday life. The collection includes texts from ordinary people originally written in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Armenian, Greek, Hebrew, Italian and Persian languages. The book accelerates the move away from a state-centered approach to Ottoman history.

Currently, Karateke is working on a project called “Ottoman Turkish: The Cultural History of a Language,” in which he aims to narrate the history of the language by exploring and reconstructing the changing perceptions of the Turkish language over several centuries. Karatake is the editor for the “[Ottoman and Turkish Studies](https://www.academicstudiespress.com/search-results-grid/?series=ottoman-and-turkish-studies)” book series at Academic Studies Press and co-editor for “[The Ottoman Empire and its Heritage](https://brill.com/display/serial/OEH?language=en)” series at Brill Academic Publishers.

**Christopher J. Wild** has been named the Peter B. Ritzma Professor in the Department of Germanic Studies and the College.

His wide-ranging scholarship covers the intersection of literature, theater, history, philosophy and religion from the Reformation to the early 19th century in Germany and beyond. In his research, Wild considers the role and impact of religious thought and practice in processes and phenomena considered genuinely modern and secular. On the other hand, he analyzes the mediality and formal semantics of European and German theater from its start in ancient Greece through modernism.

In his first book, “[Theater der Keuschheit—Keuschheit des Theaters, Zu einer Geschichte der (Anti-)Theatralität von Gryphius bis Kleist](https://books.google.com/books/about/Theater_der_Keuschheit_Keuschheit_des_Th.html?id=-AVmAAAAMAAJ)” (2003), Wild’s research interests converged as he investigated how religious sentiment influenced the historical transformation of German theater from the Baroque to Classicism. His book “[Descartes’ Meditative Turn: Cartesian Thought on Spiritual Practice](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=37214),” to be published in March 2024 by Stanford University Press, explores why Descartes borrowed his title for his most important work from a religious genre and how his philosophical reasoning can be considered meditative. Currently, Wild is working on a book project examining how the reform of religious media launched by Martin Luther and others paved the way for modern media technologies and practices.

#### Division of the Physical Sciences

**Henry Hoffmann** has been named the Liew Family Chair and Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the College.

Hoffmann leads the Self-aware computing group at UChicago and conducts research on adaptive techniques for power, energy, accuracy, security, and performance management in computing systems.

He has spent the last 22 years working on multicore architectures and system software in both academia and industry. He also founded the UChicago CS department’s EDI committee in 2020.

He completed a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT where his research on self-aware computing was named one of ten “World Changing Ideas” by Scientific American in December 2011. He received his SM degree in Electrical Engineering and

Computer Science from MIT in 2003. As a Masters student he worked on MIT’s Raw processor, one of the first multicores. Along with other members of the Raw team, he spent several years at Tilera Corporation, a startup which commercialized the Raw architecture and created one of the first manycores. His implementation of the BDTI Communications Benchmark (OFDM) on Tilera’s 64-core TILE64 processor still has the highest certified performance of any programmable processor.

Hoffmann received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) in 2019 and the Department of Energy Early Career Award in 2015. He is a member of the Samsung Security Hall of Fame and of the ASPLOS Hall of Fame. He has a Test of Time Honorable Mention from FSE 2021 for his work on Loop Perforation and approximate computing.

!**Bo Li** has been named the first Neubauer Associate Professor of Data Science in the Department of Computer Science and the College.

Li’s research addresses trustworthy machine learning from both theoretical and practical aspects and aims to enable reliable machine learning algorithms and systems in the real world, such as safe autonomous vehicles, federated (distributed) learning, and trustworthy large language models. She focuses on several interconnected aspects, such as robustness, privacy, generalization, and their underlying connections.

She been recognized by a long list of notable awards and fellowships for young faculty. She is a Sloan Fellow, MIT Technology Review TR-35 innovator, and recipient of the IJCAI Computers and Thought Award, NSF CAREER, Intel Rising Star Faculty award, Symantec Research Labs Fellowship, Dean’s Award for Excellence in Research, C.W.

Before joining ETH, Zhang finished his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin-​​Madison and spent another year as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University.

His work has received recognitions such as the SIGMOD Best Paper Award, SIGMOD Research Highlight Award, Google Focused Research Award, an ERC grant, and has been featured and reported by Science, Nature, the Communications of the ACM, and various media outlets such as Atlantic, WIRED, Quanta Magazine, etc. He also currently serves as the co-editor-in-chief of DMLR, a new member of the JMLR family focusing on data-centric machine learning research.

#### Division of the Social Sciences

**Greg Kaplan** has been named the Alvin H. Baum Professor in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics and the College.

Kaplan is a leading applied economist focusing primarily on macroeconomics and household behavior, whose findings have attracted significant attention in academic and policy circles. He has published extensively on the topics of monetary and fiscal policy, risk sharing, inequality, unemployment, household formation, migration and consumer spending.

Kaplan’s research has established the existence and importance of wealthy hand-to-mouth households in the United States. These households, accounting for about a quarter of total US households, own substantial illiquid assets but few liquid assets, resulting in consumption that closely tracks income despite high net worth. Since these wealthy hand-to-mouth households represent a significant share of aggregate consumption, they have major macroeconomic implications that Kaplan has explored in Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models.

**Joseph Masco** has been named the Samuel N. Harper Professor in the Department of Anthropology and the College.

An internationally recognized scholar operating in the intersections of science studies, anthropology and American culture, Masco’s contributions to our understanding of the imbrication of technoscientific revolution, existential risk and national security have unfolded across a trio of books: the award-winning “The Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Cold War New Mexico” (2006); “The Theater of Operations: National Security Affect from the Cold War to the War on Terror” (2014); and “The Future of Fallout, and Other Episodes in Radioactive Worldmaking” (2021).

Marked by a keenly sensitive attention to materiality, affect and psychosocial meaning, Masco’s work has brought international recognition. His latest publications include an edited volume with Deborah Thomas, “Sovereignty Unhinged: An Illustrated Primer for the Study of Present Intensities, Disavowals and Temporal Derangements” (2023), and a co-edited volume with Lisa Wedeen, “Conspiracy/Theory” (2024), which considers the stakes of epistemology in an age of disinformation and polarization. His work continues via a long-running project at the Neubauer Collegium on “Engineered Worlds,” a collaboration focused on planetary scale environmental emergency.

Masco’s work has been supported by the American Council of Learned Societies, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities and The Wenner-Gren Foundation. He has been a residential fellow at the School for Advanced Research, held a Benjamin Meaker Visiting Professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study (University of Bristol) and has been a member of the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton). In 2017, he was awarded a Faculty Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching and Mentoring at the University of Chicago.

**Mauricio Tenorio** has been named the Gustavus F. and Ann M. Swift Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of History and the College.

A prolific author of 15 books and well over 50 papers, many of them with top academic publishers and journals, Tenorio is recognized for his extraordinary range of expertise as well as his unparalleled originality as a thinker. His first book, “Mexico at the World’s Fairs: Crafting a Modern Nation” (1996), set the tone by opening with remarks about how “A Thousand and One Nights” might be seen as a model for historical narrative, given the “chaos” that the historian is presented with by actuality.

Tenorio’s succeeding works on the history of cities, languages, and conceptions of history—from “‘I Speak of the City’: Mexico City at the Turn of the Twentieth Century” (2013) to “Clio´s Laws: On History and Language” (2019), among others—have similarly shown a remarkable ability to link the whimsical to the profound, the psychological to the sociological, and the intimately particular to the universal.

#### Booth School of Business

**Veronica Guerrieri** has been named the Ronald E. Tarrson Distinguished Service Professor of Economics.

The Williard Graham Faculty Scholar at Chicago Booth, she is also a fellow of the Econometric Society, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a research fellow at the Center for Economic Policy Research, and the co-director of the Macro Initiative of the Becker Friedman Institute. Guerrieri was a managing editor of the Review of Economic Studies in 2017-2021. She is also a consultant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and in 2021 she has been a consultant for the Italian Prime Minister. Guerrieri’s work focuses on macroeconomics, labor and financial markets, business cycles, and growth.

She won the Bernácer Prize in 2015 for the best European economist under 40 in macroeconomics and finance, the Carlo Alberto medal in 2013 for the best Italian economist under 40, the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship in 2011, and the Excellence Award in Global Economic Affairs in 2010 from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

**Guido Lorenzoni** has been named the first Robert W. Fogel Distinguished Service Professor.

His fields of research are macroeconomics and international finance. His work has focused on various innovations in macro modeling motivated by current events. He has worked on building models with heterogeneous consumers to interpret the Great Recession and to study the effect of house price cycles on aggregate activity. He also worked on models of sovereign debt applied to the Euro crisis, and on multi-sector models applied to the effect of the Covid pandemic on the US economy and on the post-pandemic recovery. His most recent work focuses on interpreting recent inflation dynamics and on the connection between distributional conflict and the inflation experience.

Lorenzoni is also a research associate at the National Bureau for Economic Research and a consultant for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Before joining the UChicago faculty, he worked at Princeton, MIT and Northwestern. He received the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship and is an elected fellow of the Econometric Society. He is a co-editor of the Journal of the European Economic Association and an associate editor of the American Economic Review. In 2021 he served as consultant for the Italian PM Mario Draghi.

She served as the Vice President of the Society for Social Work and Research and as the Chair of the Asian Caucus of the Society for Research on Child Development. Choi has led the Midwest Longitudinal Study of Asian American Families (MLSAAF), a longitudinal survey research following about 800 Filipino- and Korean-American families since 2014 to identify multiple developmental trajectories of young Asian Americans. Having started when the participants were adolescents who are now young adults, the study will follow them into their late twenties. Choi’s scholarship is particularly interested in the role of culture in family (such as culturally unique family processes and intergenerational cultural conflict), racial prejudice and discrimination, ethnic/racial identity, culture change and formation (acculturation), and the intersection of culture and socioeconomic class that may be unique issues for ethnic/racial and cultural minority and immigrant/migrant youth.

**Harold Pollack** has been named the Helen Ross Distinguished Service Professor in the Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice, the Department of Public Health Sciences, and the College.

Pollack’s research seeks to understand how to improve services and interventions for people who live with psychiatric or substance use disorders, and services for people who live with physical and intellectual disabilities. The faculty co-director of the University of Chicago Urban Health Lab, Pollack has authored 190 academic publications, and has served on four committees of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. A member of the UChicago faculty since 2003, he regularly advises local, state and federal officials concerning criminal justice, disability and public health policy.

# Haifeng Xu named a AI2050 Early Career Fellow

Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Data Science [Haifeng Xu](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/haifeng-xu/) has been named one of the [AI2050 Early Career Fellows](https://ai2050.schmidtsciences.org/fellows/) by Schmidt Sciences.

!The AI2050 Early Career Fellowship is an enabling fellowship to encourage postdoctoral and pre-tenure researchers to pursue bold and ambitious work on hard problems in AI, which often is multidisciplinary and typically hard to fund. Each year, approximately 10-20 early career researchers around the world are selected through a rigorous process. Early Career Fellows receive an award to support a two year project that advances their research and receive non-monetary support, such as connections to stakeholders to help them advance their research and amplify its results.

The award’s name is based on the premise that it’s 2050. AI has turned out to be hugely beneficial to society. What happened? What are the most important problems we solved and the opportunities and possibilities we realized to ensure this outcome?

[Fellows](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/ai2050-early-career-fellows-2024/) were chosen from a variety of disciplines including computer science, philosophy, economics, political science, earth sciences, and religion studies. Selected projects encompass ensuring advanced AI systems are aligned with human values, enhancing model robustness, improving the interpretability and transparency of black-box AI systems, understanding economic and disparate geographical considerations, examining the incentive structures behind content creation, and addressing climate-related challenges through AI-driven analysis of energy storage and greenhouse gas emissions, among others.

Xu’s research fits these central themes, with a focus on three main research topics. He studies machine learning in non-cooperative multi-agent environments under information asymmetry, incentive conflicts, and deception. Xu is also interested in algorithmic foundations and applications of optimal information design. In the more applied realm, Xu studies the economics of data and machine learning, such as acquiring, eliciting, selling, and exploiting information and data.

Congratulations Haifeng!

For Galib Khan (MSADS ‘22), the path to advanced education was initially one he never intended to follow. A graduate of Rutgers University with a background in data science, he began his career at Northern Trust in Chicago, where his role focused on analyzing vast datasets using tools like PySpark and parallel programming. Despite his initial resistance to more schooling, Khan eventually decided to pursue the [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program at the University of Chicago, a decision that transformed his career trajectory. 

#### **Early influences and reluctant beginnings**

Khan’s journey began with a nudge from [Francisco Azeredo](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/francisco-azeredo-phd/), an MS in Applied Data Science professor at UChicago whom he met early in his career. Azeredo saw potential in Khan and encouraged him to consider the MS program. “I was adamant not to go back to school—after graduating I thought I was done with it,” he recalls, laughing. However, Khan soon recognized that advancing in the evolving field of data science required more than just his bachelor’s degree. “In this field, a bachelor’s degree is not cutting it,” he explains. “That’s why I ultimately decided to enroll in the program at UChicago.” 

Beyond simply encouraging Khan to enroll, Azeredo became an important colleague during Khan’s time in the program. Azeredo later offered Khan the opportunity to be his teaching assistant, deepening Khan’s experience in data modeling. “Even now, Azeredo and I still talk here and there about modeling and complex computations,” Khan says. “We try to help each other out whenever we can.” Azeredo’s support extended beyond academic advice, evolving into a long-term professional relationship that has contributed to Khan’s growth. 

#### Balancing theory and application in MS-ADS program

Reflecting on the program’s structure, Khan found that UChicago’s curriculum provided a well-rounded education in both theoretical and applied data science. Although he describes the curriculum as “standardized”—covering classic topics like linear and logistic regression—he credits the program’s network as an invaluable asset. The connections he formed during the program have been key, especially in a field as versatile as data science. “We recently had an alumni meetup, and it’s incredible the kinds of conversations that happen there—like someone asking if anyone knows of any opportunities. That’s the power of being connected to people in your field.” 

Khan singles out [*Linear Algebra*](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/#accordion-tab-1), taught by instructor [Danny Ng](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/danny-ng-phd/), as particularly impactful and his favorite course in the program. “Danny does a phenomenal job of breaking the math down and exposing how models like linear regression *actually* work using Linear Algebra,” Khan says. “The way he illustrates it and walks through it—it’s really beautiful. It’s a good, solid course that helps you understand some of the classic statistical models. Not only that, but linear algebra is like the engine of this whole field when you think about it.” 

#### **Becoming a TA: sharing knowledge and building community**

Khan’s love for teaching and helping others led him to become a teaching assistant for UChicago’s *Statistical Models for Data Science* and *Reinforcement Learning* courses. “I’ve always been the guy people go to for help with programming,” he says. Being a TA allowed him to channel that passion while supporting others on their academic journey. “I really do enjoy teaching and helping out other people. Also meeting people from different backgrounds—whether they’re from the Federal Reserve, the banking, or the insurance industry. It’s a great networking opportunity.” 

#### **Finding his path and inspiring others**

Khan’s journey from a reluctant student to a TA and an aspiring adjunct professor exemplifies the power of growth through connection. Looking back, he sees his decision to pursue the MS in Applied Data Science as an impactful choice he made for his career. With a passion for teaching and a positive perspective on networking, Khan’s story serves as a guide for future students in the program—illustrating that sometimes, the most rewarding paths are the ones we least expect.

# Introducing the new PhD Program in Data Science

New PhD program will train students to become the next generation of intellectual leaders in this fast-growing field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

Reinforcing their commitment to developing innovative, interdisciplinary programs, the [Committee on Data Science](https://codas.uchicago.edu/) (CDS) recently formed to launch a doctorate in philosophy in data science. CDS focuses on developing cross-departmental expertise, with faculty members coming from a wide set of disciplines and areas of expertise.

Data science has the potential to revolutionize virtually every industry and field of study, from medicine to social sciences to corporate decision making. CDS has taken an innovative approach to this emerging discipline. The program incorporates the conventional elements of computer science and statistics with ethics, economics, law and public policy, philosophy of science, and social impact. Those in the PhD program will play a pivotal role in driving this holistic, theory-driven approach to data science.

“We’re at a historical inflection point where fundamental questions about the fields of data science and artificial intelligence need to be asked and answered,” said Michael J. Franklin, faculty co-director of the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/) (DSI), Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor of Computer Science, and Senior Advisor to the Provost for Computation and Data Science. “Our PhD program gives students the opportunity to contribute foundational knowledge and create innovative tools and methods that will power the development of this rapidly evolving field while simultaneously preparing them to meet the demands of industry and academia.”

#### Seeking intellectually-curious students

Applications are [now open](https://apply-psd.uchicago.edu/apply/) to students, with plans for the inaugural class to be admitted from a wide range of background disciplines, including computer science, statistics, mathematics, biological and physical sciences, the social sciences, and more.

“Data science is interdisciplinary by nature,” said Dan Nicolae, Elaine M. and Samuel D. Kersten, Jr. Distinguished Service Professor in Statistics and faculty co-director of DSI. “It requires individuals who not only have strong analytical skills, but also deep domain knowledge and communications skills that enable them to engage with diverse audiences on a variety of topics.”

Franklin, Nicolae, and the rest of the Committee on Data Science expect to admit the first cohort of students who reflect this value of cross-domain curiosity. “With that in mind,” said Nicolae, “our focus will go beyond the academic background of applicants to identify those who are attracted to exploring the foundational questions of data science and who are genuinely intellectually curious about this new field.”

Students enrolled in the program will take courses on foundational topics such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data ethics, data interaction, data systems and design, and scalable computing. Outside their coursework, students will also engage in cutting-edge research focusing on seven core domains: [artificial intelligence](https://codas.uchicago.edu/research/artificial-intelligence/), [data systems](https://codas.uchicago.edu/research/data-systems/), [human-centered data science](https://codas.uchicago.edu/research/human-centered-ds/), [machine learning and statistics](https://codas.uchicago.edu/research/ai-ml-and-stats/), [theory](https://codas.uchicago.edu/research/foundations/), [use-inspired data science](https://codas.uchicago.edu/research/use-inspired-ds/), and [data, AI, and society](https://codas.uchicago.edu/research/data-ai-and-society/).

#### A supportive, University-wide ecosystem

The new PhD is part of UChicago’s Data Science Initiative, a coordinated, campus-wide plan to expand education, research, and outreach in the field.

Under the initiative, the University has added more than a dozen [faculty](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/dsi-continues-to-grow-with-six-new-faculty-joining-2023-24/) to its Departments of Computer Science and Statistics in the last five years, most of whom specialize in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and data systems. In the last 5 years, the University of Chicago’s commitment to data science has led to the launch of an undergraduate major and minor, a masters of science in applied data science, and a masters of science in data science.

The [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/), launched in 2021, executes the University’s bold vision of data science as a new discipline, seeding interdisciplinary research, forming partnerships with industry, government, and social impact organizations, and supporting holistic data science education.

The University’s efforts in data science and AI also benefit from long-standing relationships with [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/), [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www.fnal.gov/), the [Toyota Technological Institute of Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu/), and the [Marine Biological Laboratory](https://www.mbl.edu/). These relationships provide the opportunity to collaborate with other top scientists and access state-of-the-art facilities.

#### How to apply

The Committee on Data Science is now accepting applications for the program, until January 4th, 2024. The first cohort will begin during the 2024-2025 academic year.

“We look forward to welcoming the first class of data science PhD students to campus and helping them become the next generation of leaders in the field,” said Angela V. Olinto, dean of the Physical Sciences Division and Albert A. Michelson Distinguished Service Professor. “The program our faculty have developed promises to provide them with both the fundamental and applied skills they need to succeed in this exciting and rapidly-growing field.”

To learn more about the Data Science PhD at the University of Chicago, join the Committee on Data Science for an informational session on [**November 16th at 5pm**](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/events/phd-in-data-science-online-information-session/).

# Jan Mrozowski’s Path from Industry Professional to Teaching in the MS in Applied Data Science Program

!For Jan Mrozowski (MSADS ‘19), the journey to UChicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program was unexpected and, at first, unplanned. Originally from Eastern Europe and having lived in various countries, Mrozowski returned from Australia in late 2013 to begin the next chapter of his career in the United States. His first job offer with GE came with an intriguing opportunity. “I got three job offers, and all of them paid similar amounts of money, but GE told me that they pay 100% tuition at the school of my choice. So I was like, okay, and I joined GE and the University of Chicago at the same time,” he recalls, describing his entry into the newly launched program.

#### **Academic Beginnings and Real-World Experience**

With over a decade of experience in marketing analytics, Mrozowski wasn’t new to data science when he entered the program. He started the Data Science function at Woolworths, Australia’s largest retailer, before the term “Data Science” was widely used, holding the title of Business Support Manager. Later, at GE, he led marketing analytics for the Sam’s Club credit card portfolio, adding valuable hands-on experience to his expertise. While he was already well-versed in analytics, the program helped refine his skills in areas like data engineering and cloud computing. “That helped me a lot in my career since I joined the program,” he says. “It definitely improved some of my skills, especially in the area of data engineering and cloud computing.”

#### **The Accidental Teacher: From Student to Professor**

Mrozowski’s journey into teaching was as unplanned as his entry into the program. While collaborating with fellow students on an assignment, a group member—who also taught at another university—noticed his expertise and encouraged him to consider teaching. This led to his first teaching role at Benedictine University in Naperville while he was still a student. His passion for teaching grew from there. “When I was talking to professors at UChicago, they were like, ‘Why don’t you TA?’ So I thought, why not?” he shares.

This early teaching experience eventually inspired him to pursue a PhD in economics in Poland, sponsored by the National Bank of his native country. Upon returning to Chicago, Mrozowski enrolled in a consulting class taught by [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/) and [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/), who were part of the new leadership of the program. He appreciated the insights and perspectives they brought to the curriculum, noting how the program continued to evolve with fresh approaches. Since then, Mrozowski has served as a TA for multiple UChicago [Applied Data Science courses](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/), including *Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics*, *Big Data and Cloud Computing*, and *Time Series Analysis and Forecasting*, among others. Reflecting on his experiences, he muses, “If I didn’t go to Europe, maybe I would be teaching by now as well.”

#### **A Love for Data Engineering**

Among the courses Mrozowski has TA’d, [Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/) stands out as a favorite. “I think data engineering is grossly underappreciated,” he explains. “Everybody’s focusing on model development, but it takes a lot of effort to prepare the data.” He shares an example from his current role as head of the risk department at Flex Shopper, where a recent intern was surprised by the complexity and time required for data preparation. “One piece of feedback she had was that she never understood how much time it takes to prepare the data for modeling.”

Mrozowski emphasizes that data engineering demands a deep understanding of data structures and access methods, which are critical for extracting and preparing data in the right format. He sees it as an essential foundation for success in the field. At every opportunity, he hires interns and employees from the program, recognizing their strong foundational skills and readiness to tackle real-world challenges.

#### **Supporting Students Through Technical Challenges**

For Mrozowski, one of the most rewarding aspects of being a TA is helping students overcome technical hurdles. “Being able to help students when they say, ‘Yes, it finally works,’” he says. Whether troubleshooting code or guiding students through challenging concepts, he takes pride in enabling their success. “You wouldn’t believe how much time I sometimes spend with data engineering students when there is a little-known issue,” he says. From ensuring compatibility with Apple’s latest processors to addressing cloud computing problems, his support often extends beyond the curriculum.

#### **Advice for New Students: Focus on Foundations and Networking**

When asked what advice he would give to incoming students, Mrozowski underscores the importance of foundational courses. “Definitely pay more attention to data engineering and big data classes, because they will set you apart and prepare for success,” he advises. He also emphasizes networking, encouraging students to attend alumni events and build connections within the program’s professional network.

#### **Looking Ahead**

Mrozowski’s unconventional path through the MS in Applied Data Science program has led him to fulfilling roles as a TA, mentor, and leader in his field. His journey—spanning multiple countries and professional milestones—highlights the importance of embracing unexpected opportunities. Mrozowski remains dedicated to supporting and inspiring students, reflecting his commitment to advancing the next generation of data science professionals.

# Largest-Ever CDAC Summer Lab Adds 55 Students, New Social Impact Track

The CDAC Data & Computing Summer Lab, designed to train and inspire the next generation of interdisciplinary computational and data scientists, welcomed high school, undergraduate, and master’s students to work on research projects with nearly 40 mentors.

Building the wide open future of data science requires bringing new students into the fold today. And at the University of Chicago, for the third consecutive year, the [CDAC Data & Computing Summer Lab](/engage/summerlab/) serves as one of those gateways. Welcoming [55 high school, undergraduate, and master’s students](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/2021-cohort/) to serve as research assistants on projects with [more than 39 mentors](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/mentors/) and adding a new “social impact” track, it’s the largest year yet for the program designed to train and inspire the next generation of interdisciplinary computational and data scientists.

For ten weeks, students will work with their mentors building new wearable devices and robots, creating privacy and security protections from machine learning systems and online data trackers, and studying the quality of broadband access in Chicago communities. They will work with sociologists, astronomers, molecular engineers, and physicists on projects that blend data and computer science with scientific exploration and real-world applications. Social impact projects will partner with non-profit organizations collecting oceanographic data, monitoring human rights violations, and investigating international finance.

“At the University of Chicago, our goal is to define the field of data science so that it can fully reach its potential for enabling world-changing research and applications,” said David Uminsky, executive director of data science initiatives at UChicago. “The Summer Lab program is an integral part of that mission. We want to foster an inclusive research environment where students from all backgrounds gain hands-on research experience and build critical data science skills, creating a future generation of data scientists representative of the world we hope the field will positively impact.”

!

**A Bigger, Broader Program**

For the second consecutive year, Summer Lab programming will be virtual due to the lingering pandemic. But as with the summer of 2020, participants will make the best of the remote format, gathering online for weekly talks and panels, research group and cluster meetings, and social events. The structure also allows for long-distance participation, with research assistants attending the Summer Lab from California to North Carolina and Vietnam to Kosovo.

That reach is also reflected in the diversity of the 2021 cohort. The cohort is almost equally split between men and women (51% and 49%, respectively) and 22% of the students are historically underrepresented and marginalized in computing. One-fifth of the undergraduates are first-generation college students, and the 17 high schoolers and incoming undergraduates come from schools across the Chicagoland area, including Lane Tech, Kenwood Academy, and the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy.

In addition to research experience, those students will also take part in an “on-ramp” workshop introducing them to basic computational skills, such as using data science libraries like NumPy and Pandas, version control with Git, and Jupyter notebooks. Weekly speaker events gather academics, national laboratory researchers, and Summer Lab alumni to discuss topics ranging from reproducibility in data science to natural language processing to broadband equity. A career development workshop illustrates the different paths that students can take with their talents and passion for science, and a symposium at summer’s end highlights videos produced by each participant, outlining their research accomplishments.

“What I see us doing even more this year is honing and expanding opportunities for students to build their academic, research, and team-building skill sets,” said Katie Rosengarten, Program Manager for CDAC and co-leader of the Summer Lab with Kyle Chard, Julia Lane, and David Uminsky. “We challenged ourselves to think of engaging talks for the program’s speaker series that help broaden students’ notions of data science, and I think we have a really good mix of new and interesting topics. And we’re continually ramping up the social programming: if the past year has taught us anything, it’s that virtual socializing doesn’t replace in-person, but it can still be fun! The cohort experience is built both through collaborating on projects as part of a research team and through connections and having fun with games.”

!

**New Track, New Applications**

The largest addition to this year’s Summer Lab is the new Social Impact track, overseen by Uminsky, Daniel Grzenda, Mindi Mysliwiec, Kathryn Mattie, and Alyssa Szynal. Instead of working with UChicago research groups, students in this cluster will work directly with organizations such as the [Schmidt Ocean Institute](https://schmidtocean.org/) (SOI), the [UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx) (UN – OHCHR), and [Inclusive Development International](https://www.inclusivedevelopment.net/) (IDI). The track is also unique in the participation of master’s students, coming from programs such as the [Master’s Program in Computer Science](https://masters.cs.uchicago.edu/), the [M.S. in Computational Analysis & Public Policy](http://capp.cs.uchicago.edu/), and the [Masters in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/).

“There’s all these smart students coming from all over the country to work on research and impactful projects, and there are plenty of cutting-edge machine learning and data science applications from our nonprofit partners that could use student support,” Grzenda said. “Students get the benefit of experiencing research while also having a practical application, and at the same time we’re bringing master’s students together with undergraduates and high schoolers in multidisciplinary teams.”

Projects include building a video processing pipeline to help SOI search and filter video data collected by their underwater remotely-operated vehicles and the creation of natural language processing algorithms to assess the reliability of sources in news articles about human rights. Other teams will help IDI expand a dashboard to monitor tree loss near palm oil mills in Indonesia and combine datasets from the World Bank and other development banks to assess the impact of major infrastructure projects on local communities.

In addition to adding a new dimension to Summer Lab, the Social Impact track also provides continuity with the [Civic Data & Technology Clinic](/news/new-clinic-leverages-data-science-for-social-and-environmental-causes/) operated by CDAC and the [Harris School of Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/). Partnerships established during the academic year can carry over into the summer, Grzenda said, while new summer projects may hand off their work to clinic students in the fall. The social impact cluster will also give Summer Lab participants and representatives from their partner organizations exposure to a wide variety of real-world applications.

“The clusters are where groups of students meet with the lab coordinator and talk about their projects all together,” Grzenda said. “So these students are going to get a full picture of nonprofit data work in human rights, energy, and marine technology. They’ll get three or four separate social impact organizations all together talking about the data science they’re doing for each.”

!

**Expanding the Data Science Pipeline**

From the beginning, a primary goal of the CDAC Summer Lab was to train and inspire future data scientists from a variety of backgrounds, in many cases providing them with their initial experience with computational tools and the research lifecycle. Three years in, the fruits of that effort are starting to show, with Summer Lab alumni advancing their data science studies and even returning to the program in advanced positions. 

Yujie Tao discovered the Summer Lab program in 2020, as a graduating senior from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Seeking experience in human-computer interaction, she was drawn to the work of [Pedro Lopes](http://plopes.org/), assistant professor of computer science at UChicago and a Summer Lab mentor. Despite the remote format of last year’s program, Tao was able to collaborate with Lopes and other students on [dextrEMS](https://youtu.be/7ahCE8F6VZg), a wearable haptic device that uses electrical muscle stimulation to manipulate a user’s fingers. In one application, the device can help people learn and perform sign language.

Tao’s experience was so positive she stayed with the University of Chicago, joining the [Predoctoral Masters in Computer Science](https://masters.cs.uchicago.edu/page/pre-doctoral-ms-computer-science) program and continuing to work in Lopes’ [Human-Computer Integration Lab](http://lab.plopes.org/). This year she has reunited with Summer Lab in the role of lab coordinator, helping new students work on HCI projects from near and afar. 

“One thing that I really like about this program is that it is quite interdisciplinary,” Tao said. “I’m in the HCI field but there are many other directions that people are pursuing. For a participant, it’s really great to see a program that embraces a wide range of disciplines, you’re just a step away from so many other research topics that could also inspire you a lot.”

Chimaobi Amanchukwu learned of the program as a high school junior in Houston, Texas, where he struggled to find computer science courses to pursue an interest in programming and research. Though intimidated at first to apply to a university program, he followed through, was accepted, and joined for the 2020 Summer Lab, working on [a natural language processing project](https://youtu.be/Q9sqWaTqGvM) with [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/). 

“The program really went out of its way to make me feel accepted and make me feel good and open to ask questions and to talk to everybody,” Amanchukwu said. “Even in the first week, I remember actually really liking the on-ramp program, the tutorial and learning process. It was just really interesting, and I wasn’t expecting to be taught at an internship.”

The experience was so positive, Amanchukwu not only applied to return to the CDAC Summer Lab in 2021, but also to enroll at the University of Chicago, where he will start as a first-year this coming fall. For his encore run as a summer research assistant, he’ll work with assistant professor [Marshini Chetty](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/marshini-chetty/), studying the privacy and data use policies of [school districts using educational technologies](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/chetty-career/). 

“Before Summer Lab, I didn’t have much of a scope of what the computer science world was like,” Amanchukwu said. “I didn’t really know there was much of an industry for research and I didn’t know about a lot of the different projects that people are coming here to pursue. But a lot of the faculty and students have ideas that I’ve never even thought of before. I’m looking forward to learning more from other people this year.”

# Master’s in Applied Data Science Autumn 2024 Capstone Showcase

MS in Applied Data Science students deliver impactful solutions through capstone projects.

The Capstone Showcase represents the pinnacle of the student experience in the University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program. This event merges academic knowledge with practical, real-world challenges across various key research areas. This year, 37 capstone teams presented their projects, leading all phases of problem-solving with the support of faculty, staff, and industry experts. While projects spanned numerous industries, data types, and methodologies, all teams exhibited professionalism, pride, and commitment to excellence. The judges observed that the Showcase featured a diverse array of research-focused, industry-generated, and independent student projects spanning healthcare, marketing, supply chain, financial services, and more.

Paula Payton is the Head of the Center for Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MInDS) at Deloitte Research & Insights. She also happened to be a distinguished industry judge for the Autumn 2024 Capstone Showcase, her third year running. Impressed with the caliber of the graduate student presentations, Payton said, “Talk about pushing back the frontiers in applied AI…. talented students presented unbelievably original solutions to classic industry problems. That was exciting for me to see as a professional in the field and also someone who cares very deeply about data science and AI education.”

One of the standout projects was “Once Upon,” a storytelling app that uses AI to craft personalized stories for children based on their imagination and preferences. The team, consisting of Hima Cheruvu, Nia Gangar, Rishika Ravindran, and Christian Piantanida, shared their inspiration: “Our inspiration came from a moment of pure frustration and imagination. A few years ago, one of our team members’ then 4-year-old neighbor tried to get Amazon Alexa to tell her a story about her favorite princess going to swimming class. Alexa couldn’t quite deliver, and her neighbor was so frustrated that she started yelling at Alexa. That experience stuck with her—it showed how much children want to hear stories that are unique and personally meaningful to them, yet existing technology struggled to meet that need.” The student team wanted to create a tool that inspires creativity while empowering kids to be part of the storytelling process.

# Master’s in Applied Data Science Summer 2023 Capstone Winner

Showcasing today’s most advanced analytics skills, Applied Data Science masters students develop solutions for today’s pressing industry challenges

The [Capstone Project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/), the culmination of the [MS in Applied Data Science program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/how-to-apply/), unites students with industry partners to solve real-world analytics problems. The Summer Showcase featured projects spanning industries, data types, and methodological approaches—with one team standing out for special recognition.

“The quality of the work was truly impressive and the teams deserve our congratulations for their hard work, professionalism, and commitment to excellence,” said [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/), Director of MS in Applied Data Science Program. “Their inventiveness was especially on display with the solutions they developed for their industry partners. We’re looking forward to staying connected and hearing about the graduates’ next achievements.”

**[UChicago Medicine](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/) | Medical Language Processing – Patient Based Radiology Question**  
**& Answering System**  
**Presenters: Ananth Prayaga, Evelyn Wu, Nitin Gupta, Vivian Yeh**  
**Faculty Advisor: [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/)**

A key challenge in healthcare today centers around optimally using the enormous quantity of unstructured medical data available to healthcare professionals. Lacking a systematic and streamlined strategy, sorting through patient information demands significant time that could otherwise be spent directly with patients.

For their [Capstone Project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/), Ananth Prayaga, Evelyn Wu, Nitin Gupta, and Vivian Yeh focused on the labor-intensive process of reading radiology reports. They used a Closed Book Question-Answering (Q&A) System and the latest AI technologies to design an intelligent knowledge receiver, which they named ContextualAI, that can respond accurately to queries without external knowledge sources.

“A central area of development in the generative AI field involves using LLMs to ingest site- or institution-specific data that can then be queried,” the team says. “Hospitals, financial services companies, and law firms don’t want to share their internal data with OpenAI or other AI systems due to security and privacy reasons. Our task involved creating a framework using an LLM that could ingest and query local data without compromising privacy or security.”

Focused on optimizing workflow efficiency, increasing productivity, and alleviating physician burnout, the team tested existing Large Language Models (LLM) and vector databases across a variety of approaches as they developed their framework. Two separate requirements drove their search for a solution: one, ingesting the unstructured data of the partner institution and, two, teaching the LLM a new skill to work with that data.

In the end, the team attained the best performance from two of [Meta’s AI tools](https://ai.meta.com/), [Llama2](https://www.llama2.ai/) and [Faiss](https://faiss.ai/index.html), which generated answers with an approximate accuracy of 70% that the team validated using patient data and human evaluations.

“But we won’t stop there,” the team says. “This is a growing field and new models are being released every few weeks, so we will continue testing as new areas for improvement arise. Our client has already started to deploy our product and has expressed strong interest in further collaboration.”

The team also highlights the transformative power of their project and its potential for applications that extend beyond healthcare into other domains. It points, they say, to a future where intelligent answers are just a question away.

“This is just the beginning of what is possible and we’re really excited to see it developed further to reach its maximum potential.”

# Master’s in Applied Data Science Winter 2024 Capstone Winners

Applied Data Science master’s students demonstrate their adeptness in modern analytics by developing practical solutions to real-world industry problems

The [Master’s in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) Winter Capstone Project represents the innovative skills of students in addressing real-world industry challenges through data-driven methodologies. On March 2, MS in Applied Data Science students, faculty, alumni, industry partners, and judges came together as nine teams presented their capstone projects that spanned numerous industries, data types, and methodologies.

At the Winter Showcase two teams were selected by the judges for special recognition. Learn more about the winning projects below:

**Deloitte: Using LLM to Build Industry Personas**

Students: Davi Aragao, Nathan Deweerdt, Mayur Kumar, Sanket Mayekar

Advisor: [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/)

Davi Aragao, Nathan Deweerdt, Mayur Kumar, and Sanket Mayekar crafted a solution for Deloitte that focuses on creating industry specific large language model (LLM) personas to enhance Deloitte’s ability to tailor strategies, communications, and products/services for effective engagement with clients. The team said, “our financial analysis indicates that our solution could save up to $1.3 million in cost savings, with more added as it scales.”

The team expressed confidence in delivering a strong prototype, comprised of a comprehensive data pipeline, a user-tailored persona and prompt generator that can be customizable based on the user’s needs, front-end web application, and a thorough evaluation process for assessing the system’s performance. The initial testing results indicate that the prototype shows great promise.

Paula Payton, who was the team sponsor and head of Data Science and Survey Advisory at Deloitte said, “this team was so resourceful in terms of identifying data sources, and you certainty proved your mettle in terms of thinking very creatively about YouTube videos to find the voice of C-suite leaders.”

**Circana: CPG Price Optimization**

Students: Jupiter Angulo, Josefina Bollini, Ben Cox, Ezra Kim

Advisor: Anil Chaturvedi

For their project Jupiter Angulo, Josefina Bollini, Ben Cox, and Ezra Kim worked with Circana to pioneer a framework aimed at understanding consumer behavior and willingness to pay. “The implication for manufacturers, product developers, and retailers is that they need to figure out ways to more effectively reach the consumer where they are and figure out what incentivizes consumers to purchase things,” the team said.

Current methodologies used to achieve this task are considered old-fashioned, time consuming, and dependent on consumer surveys. The team noted that they developed a framework that is generalizable, scalable, and uses non-survey driven methods to understand the consumer preferences that Circana wanted to do a deeper dive on. The proposed methodology consists of utilizing a generalized utility model to calculate the value of attributes across multiple categories along with price elasticities using point of sale data and item attributes.

**Honorable Mentions**

**Argonne: Real-time Object Detection for Avian-solar Interactions**

Students: Aaron Chan, Aashish Singh, Alice Wang, Weiting Ye

Advisor: Igor Yakushin

**Independent Research: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

# Meet the Autumn 2019 CDAC Discovery Grant Projects

Eight research projects and an exploratory convening that forge new computational approaches and boost applications across several fields.

The Center for Data and Computing proudly announces the Autumn 2019 class of Discovery Grants, funding eight projects and one convening that bridge disciplines and push forward the frontiers of data science and artificial intelligence. [Discovery Grants](/engage/research-funding/) provide risk-tolerant seed funding for innovative data science projects intended to achieve a clear impact on major scientific, scholarly, and societal questions.

This round of projects spans from children’s books to the Large Hadron Collider, from ancient cuneiform tablets to wearable devices that detect disease in sweat. The program will fund researchers in medicine, economics, archeology, molecular engineering, computer science, and several other disciplines, working together to tackle complex problems that spill beyond traditional academic boundaries. Though the applications are diverse, the projects overlap in their deployment of cutting-edge data and technological approaches, such as computer vision, machine learning, remote sensing, explainable AI, and predictive analytics.

Learn more about each grant recipient below. You can also read about [our inaugural cohort of Discovery Grant recipients](/news/cdac-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-data-science-discovery-projects/), awarded in early 2019. Our next call for Discovery Grant proposals will be announced in mid-2020.

[Hakizumwami Birali Runesha](https://researchinnovation.uchicago.edu/leadership/h-birali-runesha/), Research Computing Center

Early influences that depress children’s beliefs about their own ability can lead to lower educational achievement and persistent disadvantage. In particular, receiving negative messages about gender- and race-specific levels of ability have played a role in generating disadvantage for women and minorities. Children are particularly vulnerable to negative messages about race and gender, as their beliefs about their own capacities are highly malleable.

This project aims to advance understanding of these processes by improving how we estimate the extent and implications of children’s exposure to race- and gender-coded messages. It will develop, verify, and apply new methods of human-directed, machine-implemented content analysis to improve the measurement of these messages, with the goal of better understanding their extent and their contribution to inequality across race and gender.

## Learning How To Measure Scientific Images

[Gordon Kindlmann](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/gordon-kindlmann/), Computer Science  
[William Irvine](https://jfi.uchicago.edu/~william/), Physics

To reveal and understand physical laws of nature, scientists sometimes [create novel experimental systems in their laboratories](https://www.uchicago.edu/features/fragile_knots_untangle_deep_physics_questions/), which they then capture with video cameras. To fully realize what these systems are showing, however, scientists must also often create new, bespoke computational data analysis pipelines to extract key quantitative parameters from their video image data. This project seeks to discover underlying commonality between different forms of experimental scientific data analyses, and then exploit these shared properties with a combination of machine learning methods (data augmentation and active learning). Ultimately, it seeks to create a visual, interactive data analysis system, based on a neural network for image processing and visualization for display of extracted features, that will lower the human cost of creating new ways to study nature.

## Automated Prostate Cancer Detection using Hybrid Multi-dimensional MRI and Deep Learning

[Aytekin Oto](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/faculty/aytekin-oto-md), Radiology  
[Michael Maire](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/michael-maire/), Computer Science

There is a critical need for new methods for the screening and diagnosis of prostate cancer. Using conventional MRI, around 15 to 30 percent of clinically-significant cancers are missed, even by expert radiologists. The application of computer-aided detection and artificial intelligence tools to multi-parametric MRI shows promise in aiding radiologists in prostate cancer diagnosis, but low specificity and high false positive rates remain a concern. This project will assess whether the combination of deep learning methods and data from hybrid multi-dimensional MRI (HM-MRI) — a non-invasive technique developed by UChicago radiologists that provides tissue composition measures similar to the gold standard of pathology — can improve the diagnostic accuracy of detecting prostate cancer.

## Towards a Data-driven Trigger System for the Large Hadron Collider

[Yuxin Chen](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/yuxin-chen1/), Computer Science  
[David Miller](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-miller/), Physics

Data-intensive discovery science is increasingly reliant on real-time processing capabilities and machine learning workflows in order to filter and analyze the extreme volumes of data being collected. For example, the search for dark matter at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can produce more than 100 terabytes of heterogeneous, high-dimensional data each second. To filter this data, physicists use “trigger algorithms,” the creation of which is resource-intensive and prone to significant blindspots.

This project will seek to investigate the possibility of automating the trigger system of the LHC, applying recent advances in artificial intelligence, including explainable AI, active learning and imitation learning, to the energy and intensity frontiers of particle physics. The goal is to build a principled, white-box trigger system that could be succinctly explained using existing physics insights, while still having an explicit representation of uncertainty that allows for efficient exploration of the vast space of possible event data. The work will lead to new machine learning paradigms as well as novel insights in discovery science.

## Leveraging Machine Learning and Satellite Imaging to Reduce Oil and Gas Methane Emissions

[Thomas Covert](https://home.uchicago.edu/~tcovert/), Booth School of Business  
[Michael Greenstone](https://economics.uchicago.edu/directory/michael-greenstone), Economics

The meteoric rise of shale oil and gas drilling in the United States poses significant challenges for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The methane emitted from these operations has 34 times greater short-term global warming potential than CO2, thus contributing aggressively to climate change. Existing methods of measuring methane emissions are imprecise and expensive, severely limiting regulators’ ability to monitor and enforce regulations. Without reliable estimates of methane emissions, regulators are unable to efficiently target leaks, incentivize their prevention, and realize climate benefits.

This project will develop and test a data-driven approach to methane emissions monitoring and regulation, in close partnership with Colorado regulators. It will leverage large-scale administrative data such as permitting records and historical inspections to build a supervised machine learning model that predicts methane leaks at facilities. These predictions can then be used to target the collection of high-resolution emissions measurements at the facility level using state-of-the-art satellites. This breakthrough combination of machine learning and new measurement technology would provide regulators with a potentially highly cost-effective and scalable inspection targeting framework. Finally, a randomized controlled trial will rigorously estimate the impact of applying the novel technology for regulatory enforcement, and estimate the benefits of improved emissions monitoring.

## Computer-Assisted Diagnosis of Indeterminate Thyroid Lesions

[David Sarne](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/david-h-sarne), Endocrinology

Thyroid nodules are very common and 5 to 15 percent of thyroid nodules are cancerous. In order to determine whether a thyroid nodule is benign or malignant, physicians perform a biopsy of the nodule. However, in up to 40 percent of cases, this biopsy is indeterminate, meaning the pathologist cannot differentiate between benign and malignant cells. Patients are then referred for surgical excision of these nodules in order to obtain the correct pathological diagnosis. But 70 percent of patients undergoing thyroid surgery for diagnostic purposes have a benign nodule on final diagnosis, meaning surgery was unnecessary.

This project will develop machine learning software to define imaging features of benign, malignant, and indeterminate thyroid lesions on ultrasound and relate these findings with current molecular testing. This new computer-assisted diagnosis approach aims to accurately differentiate whether an indeterminate thyroid nodule is benign or malignant, thus potentially avoiding unnecessary surgery in thousands of patients every year in the US. It will foster collaborations between diagnostic and therapeutic thyroid specialists and machine learning experts to study one of the important diagnostic challenges in modern medicine.

Manually deciphering a cuneiform tablet is a laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone process. This project explores how recent advances in computer vision can assist researchers by automatically identifying symbols and words in images of cuneiform tablets. It will leverage the extensively annotated collections of the [Online Cultural and Historical Research Environment (OCHRE)](http://ochre.uchicago.edu/) as training data for machine learning vision models that preliminary results suggest are accurate up to 83 percent of the time. This discovery grant will facilitate an important step towards the goal of meaningful automatic transcription and indexing of the extensive worldwide cuneiform tablet collection.

## Health Monitoring Based on Wearable Sweat Sensors

Wearable health monitoring devices can potentially change healthcare through continuous monitoring of people’s physiological conditions. There are a variety of chemical biomarkers in human body fluids that carry vast amounts of information linked to health conditions. For example, sweat contains biomarkers that indicate conditions such as lung infections, depression, and tuberculosis. Unfortunately, the only way that doctors and patients have access to this data today is via lab tests.

We will explore engineering a wearable that features skin-compatible chemical sensors. Our sweat sensor is based on organic transistors that are engineered to be skin-conformable — an ideal candidate for a wearable device laminated on the user’s skin. This will enable real time continuous sampling of biomarkers from sweat, which could open new avenues for medicine. Furthermore, the analysis of chemical biomarkers, such as the 220 proteins that can be found in sweat, affords a diverse and complex data space. Unlike more straightforward health data, such as traditional heart monitors, the vast amount of data that is captured in a sweat sensor requires a complex analysis, which we will explore by automated machine analysis.

## An anvi’o workshop at the University of Chicago

[A. Murat Eren](http://merenlab.org/), Medicine

Advances in molecular tools and sequencing chemistry have turned every corner of biology into a ‘data-enabled’ discipline. Microbiology, the study of the most diverse and numerous form of life, has been caught in this revolution. Tremendous amounts of new data offer detailed snapshots of naturally-occurring microbial life and promise new insights into the microbial processes that make our planet tick. But the unprecedented access to endless data streams comes with a price. On the one hand, an understanding of the new ‘omics approaches and skills in computation have become de facto necessities in the journey of microbiologists. On the other hand, limited educational and training opportunities, in addition to common technical shortcomings of available software solutions, have confined a large fraction of data-enabled microbiological investigations to “what is doable” given the existing tools, rather than “what is possible” given the data. To bridge these gaps my group has developed anvi’o, a platform that facilitates state-of-the-art ‘omics analyses. Anvi’o comes with a steep learning curve but offers microbiologists full control of their data. This workshop will train a diverse group of microbiologists on anvi’o while understanding their needs in an active learning environment.

# MS in Applied Data Science shares career advice with Stagg High School students

Daniel Truesdale, Assistant Director of Enrollment Management for MS in Applied Data Science, participated in Stagg’s careers day to raise interest in Data Science

On February 6th, students from [Amos Alonzo Stagg High School](https://www.d230.org/stagg) wandered the tables of their career fair, exploring post-grad opportunities. “I didn’t know what Data Science even was before coming. Now I am considering it as an option for me after high school,” remarked one student after talking with Daniel Truesdale.

!

[Truesdale](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/daniel-truesdale/) attended the career fair for approximately 2500 students to share educational opportunities offered through the DSI, such as [Summer Lab](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/summerlab/) and the [Data4All](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/data4all/) programs. He estimated that he spoke with nearly fifty students about what data science is and how to explore career paths in the field.

Teacher Jonathan McGreal had only praise for the turnout, remarking “As a representative of UChicago, Mr. Truesdale did a great job highlighting the skillset, workload, and job outlook for Data Science. The students have a much better understanding about this booming field!”

Truesdale focused his discussions with students on how to get started in a [career in Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/), as well as pointing students to training resources and programs. “I feel like this is part of the university’s mission,” said Truesdale. “To reach out to the local community and participate in meeting their needs.”

Although the 2024 Summer Lab application has closed, students still have time to apply for the [Data4All](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/data4all/) program. It engages high school students in high-level data and coding challenges, with the goal to create a continuous, evolving computer science pathway for students, allowing them to smoothly transition from the basics of computing through high school to college and beyond.

[Applications](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrR2H6RKtJV5x0j0gKqtZOgaBHjHIqvTjxBohsS6Sar0-1vA/viewform) for the Spring 2024 Data4All program are due Friday, February 23rd.

# MS in Applied Data Science Students Present Research at National Conference

As we wrap-up Autumn Quarter 2023, here's a highlight from the MS in Applied Data Science community.

**Sampling Research**

Students in the MS-Applied Data Science program now have a research-focused option for their capstone experience. At a time when collaborations between industry and academia are vital for innovation and unlocking new sources of value, applied data scientists are broadening their perspective and deepening their skillsets by gaining exposure to the research side of the discipline.

The University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/how-to-apply/) has taken an important step to meet this demand by developing a new capstone track for students eager to try their hands at research.

While the [capstone experience](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/) has traditionally involved working closely with industry partners to solve real-world business problems, the research capstone offers students an opportunity to collaborate with faculty on a leading-edge area of data science where methodologies and applications are still actively being investigated.

“The area of research is the key,” says [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/), an associate clinical professor at UChicago who spearheaded the MS in Applied Data Science’s research capstone track. “We’re not conducting research on already well-studied areas but on the newest technologies where industry applications are still being worked out and discovered.”

The first batch of research projects focused on generative AI, an area that Pamuksuz says is calling out for research right now and full of opportunities for students to gain experience in research design.

“Our goal is to be as up-to-the-minute as possible when it comes to teaching and sharing content with our students,” he says. “GenAI is an area still full of open questions and we saw that a research-oriented approach where faculty work directly with students as they review papers, conduct experiments, and present at academic conferences would be the best way for students to understand these technologies at a fundamental level.”

**Connecting Academia to Industry**

For his part, Pamuksuz has straddled research and industry throughout his career. While earning his PhD in machine learning, he collaborated with professors in finance, marketing, and healthcare information systems to understand how these abstract methodologies connect to other disciplines.

“You can do data science and use machine learning tools on virtually anything,” he says. “That’s what really caught my eye: The research side and the applied side are in constant dialogue.”

Having led data science teams at several Fortune 500 companies and co-founded the machine-learning company Inference Analytics, Pamuksuz also continues to do his own research, attend conferences, and publish in journals. He says it gives him an advantage when teaching in the Applied Data Science classroom.

“I’ll show students how particular GenAI tools are being applied today, but then I’ll also highlight how the area is a live research area that’s still open to exploration and being looked at from various angles.”

For the first round of research projects, Pamuksuz and other faculty selected healthcare as the domain area. With solid data sets, innumerable potential use cases, and a positive social factor, the domain gives students an ideal instrument to more deeply understand and operationalize the foundational concepts driving the latest GenAI transformer models.

“Our goal was to work with students and get them to understand these models on the most basic levels, down even to figuring out what each single neuron is doing and how they’re interacting with each other and the specific journey leading to the output. These areas are still very poorly understood today.”

**PhD-Lite Experience**

For their research capstone project, Andrew Alvarez, Mary Erikson, and Tegan Keigher leveraged the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate results for CT radiology reports.

With up to fifty percent of radiologists’s time spent drafting reports today, transformer models that can automate the documenting process have the potential to save time and reduce the stress responsible for increasing burnout in recent years.

Having started their project in early 2023—just months after the groundbreaking release of ChatGPT—the team was particularly excited to dive into an area that was so timely and full of potential.

“It’s been really incredible to focus on such a central topic in the world right now and dissect the nuts and bolts taking place inside it,” says Erikson, an analytical lead at Google.

“At first the idea of building our own transformer model might’ve felt a little like we were biting off more than we could chew, but through reading the key research papers, learning in class, and talking with each other and Utku, we were able to get a handle on this new area and connect it with what we’d learned already in the program.”

Alvarez, an engagement manager at United Airlines, says that “doing something research-based gave us an entirely new experience, one that allowed us to pick up a different sort of skillset that’s still amenable to the workplace. It was something like a PhD-lite experience.”

“The capstone-related work has also helped me guide others taking their first steps into using transformer models,” Alvarez adds. “Automating areas that are putting a strain on our teams allows us to focus on the work that matters. That’s where I think these technologies will really shine.”

**Frontiers of Research**

A critical learning experience arrived when the team presented their research at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) as part of the [Conference on Machine Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CMIMI)](https://siim.org/learning-events/events/cmimi/).

The selective research-focused conference gave them the opportunity to mingle with top experts in the field and view firsthand what was taking place on the frontiers of research.  
Perhaps most significant were the questions the team received in response to their presentation.

“They asked us if we’d tried this approach, or looked at it in this way, or pre-processed data in that way,” says Keigher, a lead data scientist at United Airlines. “Learning about these other purely research-based approaches sparked ideas for us and got us thinking about how we could improve our project and test out different avenues.”

The team is now deepening their project by incorporating what they learned at the conference. Once they finalize their results, the plan is to submit their work to the ultimate research test: a peer-reviewed publication.

# National labs enlist UChicago students for help on big data projects

!

For Department of Energy national laboratories, the era of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities to solve old problems.

Those problems can range from the operational — finding and updating policies and procedures within documents — to the astronomical: determining neutrino detection events amid the noise of the universe.

Projects like these require months or years of data science work, both to pre-process the data, and to build and train the right models and algorithms to solve the problems.

The national labs partnered with the University of Chicago to focus their combined expertise and strengths on these problems through the university’s Data Science Institute Clinic course. Undergraduate and graduate students work in teams as data scientists on problems from industry, academia, and social impact organizations. The UChicago students gained real-world experience, and the labs benefited from the students’ knowledge and expertise in areas of need.

This academic year, two teams worked with Argonne National Laboratory and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory to mine big data sets and solve specific scientific and organizational problems.

“We provide a vehicle where partners can come together with students and access their expertise and talents,” said [Nick Ross](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/nick-ross/), director of the clinic. “And the national labs have been great partners. Their projects are challenging, with interesting features, and they are great mentors for our students.”

The projects were funded by [UChicago’s Joint Task Force Initiative](https://sing.uchicago.edu/national-laboratories-stewardship/joint-task-force-initiative/), which helps Argonne and Fermilab achieve mission success by opening channels of frequent communication and collaboration across institutions.

“The core interest of many of our students is on direct research,” said [David Uminsky,](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/david-uminsky/) executive director of the Data Science Institute. “There’s no better partner serving some of the best problems from science to operations than the national labs. Long term, this past year has really proven out a successful model of engagement that really does accelerate the bridges between our two institutions.”

**An easier way to find information in documents**

Argonne came to the DSI clinic with a huge challenge: All the lab’s policies and procedures are contained in thousands of documents, most of them PDFs. This organizational system isn’t ideal, especially when the DOE or US Congress decides to change a policy or procedure. Identifying which documents are impacted and therefore need to be edited to reflect these changes is very difficult for staff.

“To make changes, you need to understand all of the content in the documents and how they are related to one another,” said Matthew Dearing, the technical lead for Argonne’s Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps) initiative. “And that’s the problem we brought to students.”

The students were tasked with creating a mathematical model called a knowledge graph that would map the policies and procedures and how each document connects with the others. Ultimately, Argonne wants to use this graph to create a chatbot that staff can query for answers to policy and procedure questions.

The students extracted the text from the documents, pre-processed the data, and then used that processed data to train models to make the graph. Because they worked with text, they used natural language processing tools — a useful set of machine learning techniques that allows computers to comprehend human language.

“It is a really good project to give students intuition on how to work with any natural language processing tools,” said [Rahim Rasool](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/rahim-rasool/), the student’s mentor and a data scientist with the Data Science Institute. “It’s a great project because it’s a small contribution to a big vision of using AI to model all these documents.”

For Soren Dunn, an undergraduate student majoring in statistics, data science, and chemistry, the project gave him a good foundation for a career in data science. Not only does it involve understanding data — it also involves creating a framework and communicating your results.  “I now understand the importance of having clean data, of developing a reproducible pipeline,” he said. “And we presented to the COO of Argonne, which was fun.”

Dearing said working with the students has been “fantastic” and he has been impressed by the progress they have made each quarter. He and his team at Argonne hope to eventually start testing how they can integrate the knowledge graph with a chatbot interface.

“While Argonne has a ton of collaboration on the science side, we on the operations side don’t have as much direct collaboration with the University of Chicago,” Dearing said. “This has been a great opportunity for us, and we hope we can eventually share this project throughout the DOE complex.”

**Determining neutrino events**

At Fermilab, the [MicroBooNE](https://microboone.fnal.gov/) experiment is working to detect neutrinos — subatomic particles that interact weakly with matter, making them extremely hard to detect.

The lab’s sensitive liquid argon neutrino detectors often also record several non-neutrino events, such as cosmic ray interactions. Scientists at the lab wondered if there was a way to use AI to determine which events were neutrino interactions in real-time, so they wouldn’t need to store the data from the non-neutrino events.

The UChicago team worked with Fermilab scientists to implement a machine learning method that could take in raw experiment data and determine neutrino events. Much of the work involved processing the data (including nearly 9,000 detection events) and figuring out the best algorithms to use to ultimately train a convolutional neural network to find the correct events.

“It’s a tricky problem, because we understand the physics and can simulate these interactions well, but it’s hard to write an algorithm that can identify whether a pattern is a neutrino event or not,” said [Peter Lu](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/peter-lu/), the team’s mentor and an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow.

Tarun Arora, a master’s student in computer science, said the best part of the project was working on a real-world problem. Each week he would learn theory in his machine learning course, and then immediately be able to apply it on this project. “It was fascinating to see how data science can be applied to scientific data from a national laboratory,” he said.

Manuel Martinez, a master’s student in computational analysis and public policy, said his background in economics research hadn’t given him this level of experience in scientific computing. “Just learning how the big labs do their work has been really interesting from a computing point of view,” he said.

And because the project involves students from across disciplines and from different groups of students across quarter, “The most important part is communicating with the group and the project mentors,” said Mingyan Wang, an undergraduate student in data science and computer science. “It’s really complicated, and we all have to understand the data set, so community is key.”

Fermilab scientists said the students were key in every step of the process. “Even before we started deploying the algorithm, we had to pre-process the data, and the students had a lot of expertise in that,” said Meghna Bhattacharya, a postdoctoral associate at Fermilab.

Often, the students brought a new perspective that the scientists hadn’t considered, said [Michael Kirby](https://computing.fnal.gov/michael-kirby/), a Fermilab scientist. “As particle physicists, we have kind of worked ourselves into a default mode of operation, so it was great having really smart students who are energized about the problem and have their own wonderful, different perspective.”

Students in future DSI clinic courses will continue to work on both laboratory projects, and the lab project leaders are happy with the progress so far. “We still have a ways to go to make the network fast enough and performative enough to be used in real time, but we feel good about the path forward,” Kirby said.

# NeurIPS 2023 Award-winning paper by DSI Faculty Bo Li, DecodingTrust, provides a comprehensive framework for assessing trustworthiness of GPT models

In a year with a record-breaking number of paper submissions, Bo Li was awarded the NeurIPS Outstanding Paper Award.

From ghostwriting to investment decisions to medical diagnoses, large language models (LLMs) have a wide range of applications. The most popular LLMs, like the multiple iterations of GPT (generative pre-trained transformer), continue to undergo constant updates, but practitioners are hoping to see these models rapidly employed across diverse domains. Despite impressive examples of realistic text production, concerns around privacy, trustworthiness, and other limitations remain. Neubauer Associate Professor of Computer Science and Data Science [Bo Li](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/bo-li/)’s DecodingTrust provides the first comprehensive risk assessment platform for LLMs, and reveals some surprising findings about LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

Li’s award-winning paper, titled “[DecodingTrust: A Comprehensive Assessment of Trustworthiness in GPT Models](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/oral/73736),” offers the most comprehensive evaluation of trustworthiness to date. It defines eight trustworthiness perspectives for LLM evaluations, including toxicity, stereotype bias, adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution robustness, robustness on adversarial demonstrations, privacy, machine ethics, and fairness.

!“One major motivation here is to provide a checklist so that people can see all these perspectives to comprehensively understand a model’s ability and trustworthiness,” said Li. Her paper, written in conjunction with co-authors Boxin Wang, Weixin Chen, Hengzhi Pei, Chulin Xie, Mintong Kang, Chenhui Zhang, Chejian Xu, Zidi Xiong. Ritik Dutta, Rylan Schaeffer, Sang Truong, Simran Arora, Mantas Mazeika, Dan Hendrycks, Zinan Lin, Yu Cheng, Sanmi Koyejo, and Dawn Song, takes an organized approach to identifying previously unpublished vulnerabilities to trustworthiness threats.

Li and her co-authors reported the performance of GPT-3.5 (colloquially known as ChatGPT) and GPT-4 across all eight measures. Overall, they found that in general, GPT-4 had better performance than GPT-3.5. But these results flipped when using misleading prompts or jailbreaking techniques.

“As we know, GPT-4 has higher instruction following ability. However, if your instructions have a little bit of misleading information or malicious content, the model (GPT-4) will immediately follow it as well,” said Li. “So it’s easier to trick.” The authors hypothesize that GPT-4 is easier to fool because it follows instructions more precisely. This leads GPT-4 to be more vulnerable than GPR-3.5, which isn’t trained with as much precision.

Another surprising finding in the paper is that LLMs understand privacy-related words differently, depending on the phrasing. For example, if a model was told something “in confidence,” it interpreted the phrase differently than “confidentially” and would leak private information in one case but not the other.

Privacy protection also varied with the type of content that was requested. “We find that the model is very unlikely to leak social security numbers, but they leak other information,” explained Li. “That means they indeed, carefully tuned [the model] for security on numbers, so that they are very good. That, on one hand, shows these types of instruction: fine tuning things will help to improve the model alignment analysis. But, on the other hand, it also shows these types of methods are not enough, because we cannot enumerate all the categories or things to protect the model. We need a more systematic approach.”

The third main finding DecodingTrust demonstrated adversarial transferability across different LLMs, including closed and open models, is in general high. No one model outperformed the others across the eight measurements.

“The biggest takeaway is that no model is perfect, and surprisingly, no model dominates on all 8 perspectives. Even though we included GPT-4, which is very capable,” Li said. “But still from some perspectives, it’s not better than other models.”

DecodingTrust represents the most thorough examination into privacy, security, and bias in LLMs to date. It also includes evaluation scenarios and several novel optimization algorithms to generate challenging prompts and data to evaluate different LLMs not originally included in the paper. However, Li’s work on this topic is far from complete.

When asked about future directions, Li responded, “We are working on social harmfulness, particularly in politics, and are in discussion with some other collaborators. We will keep adding more perspectives as well, because this whole thing is still growing. New types of applications will lead to new perspectives, so we’re also maintaining and adding new models and new perspectives.”

[!](http://datascience.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/neurips-logo-svg.svg)In the meantime, Li was recognized by The Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) for her comprehensive publication. NeurIPS [awarded six papers](https://blog.neurips.cc/2023/12/11/announcing-the-neurips-2023-paper-awards/) across three categories and the 2023 competition was particularly fierce, with a record-setting 13,300 papers submitted. Li’s paper was selected from among those for the Outstanding Benchmark Award.

“Bo and her colleagues have mapped out a rigorous approach for evaluating the trustworthiness of Large Language Models,”  said Michael Franklin, Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor, Senior Advisor to the Provost for Computing and Data Science, and Faculty Co-Director of the Data Science Institute. “This paper represents a necessary step towards enabling LLMs to be put into practice safely.”

Li and her co-authors have made the benchmark [publicly available](https://decodingtrust.github.io/) to help researchers and practitioners better understand the capabilities, limitations, and potential risks involved in deploying these state-of-the-art LLMs. In addition, they created a [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AI-Secure/llm-trustworthy-leaderboard) on Huggingface for researchers and practitioners to track the trustworthiness of different models across the eight measures.

# New AI + Science Grants Fund Projects & Workshops in Chemistry, Physics, and CS Education

The second round of AI + Science grants awarded by UChicago’s Office of Research and National Laboratories Joint Task Force Initiative supports new AI applications to boost scientific discovery and education.

Artificial intelligence is a valuable lab assistant, diving deep into scientific literature and data to suggest new experiments, measurements, and methods while supercharging analysis and discovery. AI approaches hold promise for improving models of climate and the universe, transforming waste products into energy sources, detecting new particles at the Large Hadron Collider, and countless other scientific challenges.

In the second round of AI + Science grants awarded by UChicago’s Office of Research and National Laboratories Joint Task Force Initiative, three projects and two workshops will explore these new applications and how they can boost scientific discovery and education. The Joint Task Force, made up of researchers from the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory working with the [Center for Data and Computing](/), will distribute $250,000 in funding to recipients from all three institutions. The first round of AI + Science grants was [awarded last year](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/uchicago-jumpstarts-collaborations-national-labs-ai-quantum).

Since the Joint Task Force Initiative launched in 2018, the University has committed significant investments to fund national laboratory programs and operations. The University manages Argonne for the U.S. Department of Energy through UChicago Argonne, LLC and Fermilab together with the Universities Research Association, Inc. through the Fermi Research Alliance.

“Big ideas require collaboration across institutions, and the University of Chicago, Argonne, and Fermilab collectively have the power to make great leaps in combining artificial intelligence and science,” said [Juan de Pablo](https://president.uchicago.edu/directory/juan-de-pablo), vice president for national laboratories at the University. “I look forward to seeing what breakthroughs come from these grants.”

*Seed Projects*

**AI+EC (Artificially Intelligent Electrochemistry)**

Carbon dioxide emissions are a leading contributor to global climate change, but with the right electrocatalyst and electrolyte, it could instead be a new resource for energy sustainability. The team of [Chibueze Amanchukwu](https://pme.uchicago.edu/faculty/chibueze-amanchukwu), an assistant professor at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, and [Rajeev Assary](https://www.anl.gov/profile/rajeev-surendran-assary), a staff scientist at Materials Science Division of Argonne, will use AI to find new, efficient ways of “recycling” CO2 into valuable products such as ethanol and ethylene, using clean electricity generated from the sun and wind. The researchers will use quantum chemistry-informed machine learning to sift through computational and experimental data and find new electrolytes that can improve the conversion process. Experiments will then be performed using these obtained chemical insights. 

**Learned Emulators of Physics Simulations**

Researchers studying climate, astrophysics, and high-energy physics use large, complex simulations to guide experiments and test theories. These compute-intensive programs can run much faster using emulators that approximate some aspects of those models. Recently, scientists have started creating “learned emulators” using AI neural network approaches, but have not yet fully explored the advantages and potential pitfalls of these surrogates. These aspects will be examined by the team of [Rebecca Willett](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/rebecca-willett/), professor of computer science and statistics at UChicago, [Dana Mendelson](http://math.uchicago.edu/~dana/), assistant professor of mathematics at UChicago, [Prasanna Balaprakash](https://www.anl.gov/profile/prasanna-balaprakash), computer scientist at Argonne, [Jiali Wang](https://www.anl.gov/profile/jiali-wang), assistant atmospheric scientist in Environmental Science Division at Argonne, and [Rao Kotamarthi](https://www.anl.gov/profile/rao-kotamarthi), department head of atmospheric science and climate and chief scientist for the Environmental Science Division at Argonne. This team will explore the mathematical limits of these methods and quantify key trade offs related to accuracy and speed.

**Real-Time Adaptive Deep Learning with System-on-Chip Devices for Discovery Science**

Machine learning on data is typically performed after it is gathered. But advances in real-time machine learning can analyze data on the fly, allowing scientists to quickly adjust experiments to capture phenomena of interest. That’s particularly appealing to researchers using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, where a single on-chip system can absorb multiple terabytes of data each second. [David Miller](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-miller/), associate professor of physics at UChicago, [Nhan Tran](https://nhanvtran.wixsite.com/home), Wilson Fellow at Fermilab, and [Andrew A. Chien](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/andrew-a.-chien), professor of computer science at UChicago, will collaborate on the design of new hardware that enables these advanced real-time processes. The resulting “system-on-a-chip” hardware design would help both high-energy physicists and researchers in other data-intensive fields monitor data quality and detect promising results without interrupting the flow of data.

*Workshops*

**AI + Measurements Workshop**

AI can also guide scientific experiments before they are started, helping researchers find the best location to aim a telescope or choose which chemical compounds hold the greatest potential as drugs or new materials. Additionally, all modern scientific measurement requires inverting a model of the measurement process to interpret the data, and modern AI techniques have shown great promise in accelerating and improving this reconstruction. The “AI + Measurements” workshop, planned by [Eric Jonas](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/eric-jonas/) and [Yuxin Chen](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/yuxin-chen1/), assistant professors of computer science at UChicago, and [Jayakar Thangaraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayakar-charles-tobin-thangaraj-a883bb2/) of the [lllinois Accelerator Research Center (IARC)](https://iarc.fnal.gov/) at Fermilab, will dig into these opportunities for AI in meteorology, cosmology, particle physics, chemistry and other fields. The workshop will take place at Fermilab and include students and researchers from UChicago, Argonne, and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, brainstorming new collaborations combining cutting-edge AI approaches and experimental science.

**AI+Science = CS4All High School Primer Workshop**

For most Chicago Public Schools students, exposure to computer science is limited and they have little time for advanced topics such as AI or data science for societal issues. This lack of opportunity is exacerbated when students seek internships and other employment experiences and do not have the confidence in their own knowledge to see CS, data science or AI as a possible career pathway for themselves. To address this need, a team of researchers and educators from Argonne, UChicago’s Center for Data and Computing (CDAC) and Fermilab will develop a CS/AI bridge workshop that supports students from Chicago’s South Side community. In the weeklong workshop, to be held twice a year, students will develop a deeper understanding of CS, grow a tangible skillset that is grounded in scientific projects, real-world datasets, and professional tools, and connect with internship opportunities at UChicago, Argonne and Fermilab. The workshop planning committee includes [Julia Lane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-lane-9b096747/), [Nick Feamster](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/nick-feamster/), and [Kyle Chard](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/kyle-chard/) from CDAC, [Michael Papka](https://www.anl.gov/profile/michael-e-papka), [Meridith Bruozas](https://www.anl.gov/profile/meridith-bruozas) and [John Domyancich](https://www.anl.gov/profile/john-domyancich) from Argonne, and [Brian Nord](https://computing.fnal.gov/brian-nord/) from Fermilab.

# New DSI Faculty Haifeng Xu Brings Strategic Intelligence to NeurIPS 2022

Xu, one of five DSI researchers with papers accepted to the prestigious machine learning conference, is co-author on three papers examining the economics of data and AI.

Algorithms play a large and ever-increasing role in daily life. Behind the scenes of casual activities such as hailing a rideshare, buying an item online, or deciding what movie to watch, machine learning algorithms set prices and offer recommendations. Models make major decisions every second in digital platforms, finance, security, medicine, and other industries. But at some point, these computational “agents” must interact with the intelligence of humans, leaving them open to manipulation and inefficiency.

Haifeng Xu, assistant professor of computer science and data science at the University of Chicago.

[Haifeng Xu](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/haifeng-xu/), a new assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and the Data Science Institute, wants to design better algorithms that strategically work with humans on the most challenging problems. His research has taken him into subjects such as the economics of data and machine learning, information design, and theoretical questions around uncertainty and complexity. Three co-authored papers accepted to this year’s edition of the prestigious [Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems](https://nips.cc/) (NeurIPS), represent the breadth of this work, as Xu establishes his [SIGMA research lab](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/sigma/index.html) at UChicago.

The three papers describe new approaches for optimizing advertisers’ bidding strategy, determining the value of data used in machine learning models, and reverse engineering the motivations of economic actors in an adversarial struggle. Together, the findings connect Xu’s earlier work at the University of Virginia, Harvard, and USC on information design to his current interests in the economics of data.

“Information design is about how to use information in a strategic way that can improve a system’s total welfare,” Xu said. “If you think about a machine learning algorithm, it’s really trying to distill information from data. But when you have this information, how should you use it? How can you disseminate it to the people who really need it? One solution is to design a market for your information, for data or for learning algorithms.”

In “[CS-Shapley: Class-wise Shapley Values for Data Valuation in Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06800),” Xu and co-authors Stephanie Schoch and Yangfeng Ji explore one important question in creating these markets: what is the value of data to a machine learning model? Researchers often look at how the data improves the overall accuracy in a model that, for example, classifies photos of animals. Xu and colleagues developed a new approach looking at the data’s “in-class” influence – how much a particular cat photo improves the ability to identify cats, rather than how it is used for dogs or other animals. The approach they created not only provided a new method of valuing data, it actually improved the performance of these models.

“What really surprised us was when we applied it to real experiments, and it worked better,” Xu said. “We were able to significantly improve most of the benchmarks you find in the literature by giving a better evaluation about the value of the data.”

!Another paper, “[Incrementality Bidding via Reinforcement Learning under Mixed and Delayed Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01293)” with Ashwinkumar Badanidiyuru and Zhe Feng of Google Research and Tianxi Li of the University of Virginia, tackled a different kind of strategic model. On popular websites, advertisers bid in auctions to show their ads to users, a complex sequential decision making problem with delayed and uncertain rewards (whether the user makes a purchase). The researchers developed a new reinforcement learning algorithm for learning and estimating incrementality, which is the causal effect of showing an ad to a consumer, enabling smarter bidding strategies.

The work is both an example of Xu’s vision for designing algorithms that can act optimally in highly competitive environments and, in its collaboration with Google, the unique strengths of an academic/industry partnership. “It’s something that I am very excited about: the innovation really comes from interdisciplinary thinking about a real-world problem,” he said.

Xu’s [third NeurIPS paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01380.pdf), with his PhD student [Jibang Wu](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/jibang-wu/) at UChicago as well as Weiran Shen, and Fei Fang, attacked a fundamental problem in economics called Stackelberg Games. Here, the goal is to observe the behavior of a system, such as an online shopping platform or a stock market, and use it to reverse engineer the motivations of its participants. Xu and his collaborators created a more efficient solution by moving away from the classical economic expectation that people always make the best possible decision.

“Bounded rationality has always been a stringent assumption for economic analysis; there has been a whole literature in behavioral economics to study boundedly rational agent behaviors ,” Xu said. “Interestingly, we show that this relaxation actually kills two birds with one stone. First of all, it makes the model more realistic, and secondly, it actually speeds up the learning of the agent’s preferences from observing their boundedly rational behaviors.”

The insights from this model could be used in various real-world situations, Xu said, including a cybersecurity scenario where the defenders are trying to learn the incentives of an attacker in order to predict and thwart their future activities.

The interdisciplinary methods and applications of such work helped draw Xu to the University of Chicago, where he hopes to form new bridges between UChicago CS, the Data Science Institute, and the Booth School of Business. One eventual aim of his interest in the economic science of data and AI is to build a market for AI algorithms, an “Uber for machine learning” where effective model design and data sharing is incentivized.

“UChicago really cares about creating new disciplines and foundational work, and these are the things that I have personally been very excited about as well,” Xu said. “The economic science of data is a very, very new discipline, and I feel like this is one of the best and most suitable places to make it happen.”

Other Data Science Institute authors presenting at NeurIPS 2022 include faculty co-director [Dan Nicolae](https://stat.uchicago.edu/people/profile/dan-nicolae/), faculty director of AI [Rebecca Willett](https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu/), and assistant professors [Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com/) and [Victor Veitch](http://victorveitch.com/).

# New Fellows Program Taps CAPP Students to Improve Congress Through Tech

The Congressional Modernization Fellowship provides a unique opportunity for UChicago Master’s students to work directly with the United States Congress on technology solutions that improve government efficiency and effectiveness.

Data and technology unlock a multitude of powerful, novel solutions to improve government functionality, enhancing the ability of public institutions to better serve their citizens. A new University of Chicago program, the Congressional Modernization Fellowship, provides a unique opportunity for UChicago Master’s students to work directly with the United States Congress on technology solutions that improve government efficiency and effectiveness.

The fellowship, made possible by a gift from Harris School of Public Policy alumnus Galen Hines-Pierce, MPP ‘17, will fund nine students over three years to work on projects in Chicago and Washington D.C. with the legislative branch of the federal government. First-year students in the [Master of Science in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MS-CAPP)](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) program are eligible to apply to the program, which is a partnership between [POPVOX Foundation](https://www.popvox.org/), the Data Science Institute (DSI) and the [Harris School of Public Policy](http://harris.uchicago.edu).

“For the last nine years, the MS-CAPP program has trained emerging leaders to translate expertise in data and evidence into effective policy solutions,” said Katherine Baicker, dean and Emmett Dedmon Professor at the Harris School of Public Policy. “The Congressional Modernization Fellows program creates an exceptional opportunity for MS-CAPP students to learn these skills while having real-world impact on the functioning of the US federal government.”

Fellows will work with Congressional staff and members on projects that deploy advances in data and computational tools and approaches intended to improve government workflows and operations.

Galen Hines-Pierce, MPP ‘17

“Around the world, democracies are facing increasingly complex challenges, both foreign and domestic,” said Hines-Pierce. “As free and open societies come together to support one another in an era of rising competition, it’s all the more vital to strengthen our democratic institutions here at home. While technology can’t solve political problems, it can help to uncover hidden consensus, make cooperation and coordination more efficient, and enhance Congress’s ability to gather, make sense of, and more quickly act on information. It’s been an honor to partner with Harris, DSI, and POPVOX in designing and supporting this urgent and important effort.”

The program will begin in Spring 2023 with fellows engaging in projects through the [Data Science Clinic](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/data-science-clinic/), a project-based course where students work in teams as data scientists with real-world clients from industry, government, academia, and social impact organizations. Fellows will then relocate to Washington DC for the summer quarter to continue their projects in-person with Congressional offices.

In autumn and winter quarters, fellows will return to UChicago as research assistants, maintaining continuity on the projects as new students join the team. Fellows will be supervised by Assistant Clinical Professor [James Turk](https://cs.uchicago.edu/news/civic-tech-pioneer-james-turk-joins-uchicago-cs-to-teach-in-mpcs-capp/), a civic technology pioneer who worked as Labs Director with the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/) and launched the [Open States Project](https://openstates.org/) to gather and publish legislative data from local and federal governments.

“Social impact and experiential learning are two of the defining principles of Data Science Clinic and the Data Science Institute writ large,” said David Uminsky, executive director of the DSI. “Integrating this new fellowship with the clinic course will broaden its footprint, providing both the selected fellows and their teammates in the clinic with invaluable experience applying data-driven techniques to real-world challenges at the federal level.”

Fellows will also have the opportunity to collaborate with POPVOX Foundation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that works “to inform and empower people, make government work better for everyone, and contribute to the creation and adoption of effective, responsive modern governing infrastructure.”

Marci Harris, Executive Director of POPVOX Foundation explained: “By partnering with the University of Chicago, we can help prepare future leaders in this space while developing technological solutions to increase technical capacity in the legislative branch and improve public engagement.”

The application period for the first year of the fellowship is now closed, and the inaugural cohort of fellows and projects will be announced this spring. Students starting the MS-CAPP program in the 2023-24 and 2024-25 academic years will have the opportunity to apply for subsequent installments of the program.

# New Fellowship Program for Faculty at Nigerian Universities

!We are pleased to announce a new Faculty Fellowship program designed to support junior faculty at Nigerian universities interested in advancing and accelerating the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) within the natural sciences. Funded by [Schmidt Sciences](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/), the program will host 20 junior faculty members over the next two years, enabling them to engage in pioneering research by capitalizing on the university’s prestigious programs, esteemed faculty, and dynamic data science ecosystem. In addition to the University of Chicago, the University of Oxford, Imperial College London, and the University of Michigan have also received funding from Schmidt Sciences to expand their programs to welcome faculty fellows. 

This initiative builds upon the [Schmidt Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/partnerships/schmidt-fellows/), launched at UChicago in 2022 by Prof. [Rebecca Willett](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/rebecca-willett/) (Computer Science), Prof. [David Freedman](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/david-freedman/) (Neurobiology), and Prof. [Joshua Frieman](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/joshua-frieman/) ([Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/joshua-a.-frieman/)). The Schmidt Faculty Fellows will participate in various training activities, seminars, conferences, and workshops, receiving specialized training in AI and machine learning methods pertinent to their research. Together with current Schmidt postdoctoral fellows, they will form a distinguished cohort of scholars engaged in collaborative training and research activities across the data science and AI ecosystem at UChicago.

Prof. [Chibueze Amanchukwu](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/chibueze-amanchukwu/) (Pritzker Molecular Engineering) was instrumental in facilitating collaborations with Nigerian universities. “The AI revolution is sweeping the planet with promises to change science and society. Ensuring that Nigerians are active participants in using AI for our scientific challenges as well as shaping the direction that AI takes in the planet is of great importance. I am really excited about the program because it shows UChicago and Schmidt Sciences commitment to ensuring that AI+Science has no borders,” said Prof. Amanchukwu.

Prof. Benjamin Aribisala, Professor of Computer Science at Lagos State University; Prof. Olufade Onifade, Professor of Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics at the University of Ibadan; and Dr. Aderonke Sakpere, lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Ibadan played a key role in developing this program.

Upon their return to Nigeria, faculty fellows will share the computational skills acquired at  UChicago with their students and colleagues. This program represents a unique opportunity for faculty fellows to emerge as leaders in Africa’s AI in Science movement.

# New UChicago-City Colleges of Chicago Program Will Train Next Generation of Data Science Educators

A new UChicago - CCC Data Science Preceptorship Program, now accepting candidates to start in 2022-2023, will place recent Ph.D. graduates in teaching roles at both institutions and provide them with faculty mentoring and training in creating effective and inclusive learning environments.

A new partnership between the University of Chicago and City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) will seed the next generation of data science educators and broaden participation in this rapidly growing new field, building an inclusive, scalable model for expanding STEM education and careers nationwide.

The **UChicago – CCC Data Science Preceptorship Program**, [now accepting candidates](https://apply.interfolio.com/100139) to start in 2022-2023, will place recent Ph.D. graduates in teaching roles at both UChicago and the City Colleges and provide them with faculty mentoring and training in creating effective and inclusive learning environments. The program is part of [a broader partnership](https://civicengagement.uchicago.edu/news/university-of-chicago-city-colleges-of-chicago-join-forces-to-increase-diversity-in-science-careers) between UChicago and CCC to strengthen STEM educational and career opportunities and create a more diverse field of professionals entering the sciences.

“A strong understanding of data science will be essential across countless fields in the coming years and this collaboration will ensure our next generation of data scientists will not only be able to analyze and apply data but also incorporate new perspectives and lived experience into solving critical real-world problems,” said [Angela V. Olinto](https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/people/profile/dean-of-the-physical-sciences-division/), Dean of the Physical Sciences Division at UChicago. 

“The UChicago and CCC Data Science Preceptorship will develop the next generation of teaching faculty for data science, engineering and computer science education, emphasizing STEM pedagogy and broadening the preceptors’ classroom skills to enhance their teaching portfolios,” said [Dan Nicolae](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~nicolae/), Faculty Co-Director of the Data Science Institute (DSI), Chair and Professor of Statistics, and Professor of Human Genetics, Medicine, Section of Genetic Medicine and The College at University of Chicago. “By embedding cutting-edge data science education in local community institutions, we aim to amplify career skills and STEM interest that leads to specialized jobs, higher earning potential, and a next generation of data scientists that reflects the diverse communities of our world.”

Graduates with skill in data science, technology, computing, and other related STEM fields are in high demand among employers, and the number of STEM degrees issued in the United States has grown in recent years. However, diversity in these fields has lagged behind overall trends. 

According to a Pew Research Center analysis, in 2018 Latinx students earned 12% of the bachelor’s degrees awarded in the United States in STEM fields, and Black students earned just 7%. In 2019, Black students made up just 6.8% of all enrollees in master’s degree programs, 3.7% of all doctoral programs, and just 1.6% of postdoctoral researchers in science, engineering, and health fields. 

The UChicago-CCC partnership will identify, create, and accelerate new joint initiatives focused on research and education opportunities for students and faculty in the sciences, as well as build new pathways for CCC students to attend UChicago and other outstanding research-oriented institutions.

“This relationship is about harnessing two of our city’s higher education assets to create unprecedented opportunities and, ultimately, a more inclusive economy,” said City Colleges of Chicago Chancellor [Juan Salgado](https://www.ccc.edu/menu/pages/chancellor.aspx). “With this collaboration agreement, we increase our capacity as an institution to be responsive to our community. We’ll not only create new pathways and internship opportunities for our students, but we’ll also build a pipeline of educators prepared to teach in new and emerging STEM fields. It promises to be transformative not only for our students but for our faculty — and for the students and faculty of the University of Chicago as well.”

One systemic barrier for improving minority participation in these areas is a shortage of qualified STEM teaching faculty, with a critical need in data and computing fields where student demand is rising. A lack of scalable post-graduate training pathways that provide the skills necessary for students to successfully enter these growing STEM education career roles compounds this shortage. Critically, these skills must go beyond technical expertise to training in equitable and inclusive teaching practices. 

“We posit that an integrated, jointly-mentored and designed teaching postdoctoral position between CCC and UChicago will produce the next generation of STEM educators capable of successfully engaging students from diverse communities,” said [Michael J. Franklin](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/michael-franklin/), Faculty Co-Director of the Data Science Institute, Liew Family Chair of Computer Science, and Senior Advisor to the Provost for Computation and Data Science. “Such a model of training will have immediate positive impacts on both institutions, particularly for students who come from underserved communities.”

The [UChicago – CCC Data Science Preceptorship Program](https://apply.interfolio.com/100139) will accept recent Ph.D. graduates in data science, mathematics, statistics, computer science, and other STEM fields. Each preceptor will work a two-year term with an optional third year, and will alternate teaching between courses at UChicago and CCC. Preceptors will be partnered with a faculty mentor at each institution, receiving instruction and guidance on pedagogy, course development, assessment, student life and disability services, and other important skills for creating an inclusive learning environment.

In addition to broadening the pipeline for STEM education locally in Chicago, the partnership hopes that this preceptorship program will serve as an adaptable and scalable model for efforts to improve diversity in data, computing and other fields.

“The UChicago Data Science Institute was founded with the distinct goal of increasing the number of traditionally underrepresented groups entering data-centric STEM fields while producing the next generation of diverse data science faculty, researchers and educators,” said [David Uminsky](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-uminsky/), DSI executive director. “As DSI seeks to train the next generation of outstanding, culturally-informed data science educators, this proposed preceptorship is a novel and sustainable way to achieve this mission.”

# Online Database Brings Transparency to Financing of Mega-Development Projects

Free, searchable, open-source website created by DSI lifts veil on more than 200,000 projects, human rights and environmental complaints against them.

!

A new searchable [website](https://debit.datascience.uchicago.edu/) compiling publicly available data from 17 global development banks, unveiled today by University of Chicago Data Science Institute (DSI), [Inclusive Development International](https://www.inclusivedevelopment.net/) and the Schmidt Family Foundation’s [11th Hour Project](https://11thhourproject.org/), promises to bring transparency and accountability to the financing behind major development projects.

The [Development Bank Investment Tracker](https://debit.datascience.uchicago.edu/about) (DeBIT)’s online database monitors investment dollars in and official complaints against more than 200,000 investment-bank-financed projects around the world, including extractive efforts like oil and gas development, metal and mineral mining, electrical infrastructure and industrial agriculture. The site also catalogs official complaints—ranging from environmental damage to corruption to the uncompensated displacement of entire villages—against the projects, with data provided by [Accountability Counsel](https://www.accountabilitycounsel.org/).

Inclusive Development International, which previously gathered project financial data manually as part of its [Follow the Money to Justice initiative](https://www.inclusivedevelopment.net/following-the-money/), partnered with DSI to create the tool under the 11th Hour Project-funded [Data Science for Social and Environmental Impact](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/11th-hour-project/#:~:text=UChicago%20students%20have%20the%20opportunity,with%2011th%20Hour%20Project%20grantees.).

“The goal of DeBIT is to make this data more publicly available, easier to search, and easier to use, to find which companies are running projects and where those projects are,” said Daniel Grzenda, staff data scientist at DSI. “We take all that data and give users a clear view of the funding, where it’s coming from, and how it’s affecting the local community that it’s supposed to be helping.”

Information available on DeBIT is expected to be used by community advocates holding development finance institutions accountable for displacement or pollution, journalists covering development and environmental issues, and watchdog organizations monitoring projects for corruption. DeBIT is open source, allowing researchers worldwide to add to and help create the most comprehensive trove of records about private bank-funded development.

DeBIT is the latest addition to Inclusive Development International’s Follow the Money suite of tools and resources, funded in part by the 11th Hour Project, to empower advocates supporting communities that are adversely impacted by investment and development activities.

“We are so excited to be launching DeBIT, which will expand the reach of our Follow the Money methodology and make it more accessible for advocates on the frontlines protecting community rights.” said Dustin Roasa, research director at Inclusive Development International. “Working with the DSI has really opened our eyes to what technology and data science can do.”

“We need to level the playing field for frontline communities whose rights are threatened by major development projects,” said Joseph Sciortino, executive director of The Schmidt Family Foundation. “One way to do that is to arm these communities with high-tech data tools that have previously been out of reach.”

DSI serves as an important resource for nonprofits like Inclusive Development International and other 11th Hour Project grantees to access software and data science expertise. DeBIT is the first major public, open-source tool created through the partnership.

The DeBIT project came together with support from University of Chicago undergraduate and graduate students who developed their data, software and research skills while addressing a real-world problem—the challenges of holding investment banks accountable for environmental and human rights impacts of their work. With DeBIT lead developer Launa Greer, DSI software engineer Trevor Spreadbury, and Grzenda, the student teams built web scrapers for gathering data from development bank websites, engineering them to catch future additions and edits.

“It gave students experience in the data collection system side of data science while also engaging them in a cause that a lot of our students care about,” Grzenda said.

The DeBIT project reflects the collaborative 11th Hour Project community in merging data collected by Inclusive Development International and Accountability Counsel. DSI plans to expand the tool by adding mediation agreements and the role of nonprofits and watchdog groups in helping complaints reach resolution.

“The collaboration was really key to developing those tools to equip people to do this research,” said Roasa. “We’re eager to get these tools and investigative techniques into the hands of as many people as possible.”

Students discuss the potential of data science with community organizations at the annual Scope-a-thon event hosted by UChicago’s South Side Civic student group.

*By Kathryn Mattie, Program Director of Computational Analysis & Public Policy*

The University of Chicago has received a grant from the [Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN)](https://www.newamerica.org/pit/), a partnership of universities dedicated to combining public policy and digital innovation for societal benefit, to create the Community Data Fellows program, a new initiative that works toward the interests of marginalized Chicagoans. To that end, the Fellows program will pair local, community-based nonprofit organizations with UChicago graduate students (Fellows) who possess skills in technology and policy analysis.

The Fellows program follows in the footsteps of UChicago’s annual Scope-a-thon event (hosted by UChicago’s [South Side Civic student group](https://southsidecivicdotnet.wordpress.com/)) and [Community Programs Accelerator](https://communityprograms.uchicago.edu/) initiative, both of which facilitate connections between UChicago and local community organizations to leverage data and technology in service of those organizations’ missions.

“We’re thrilled to receive this generous grant from PIT-UN to build on the student-led community partnerships that begin during Scope-a-thon,” said David Uminsky, Executive Director of the Data Science Institute at UChicago and the principal investigator for the program. “By building year-long partnerships between Chicago-based community organizations and a diverse group of UChicago graduate students, the program will enhance these organizations’ capacities to fulfill their social impact missions and help train the next generation of public interest technologist.”

Students in the University’s [Master of Science in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP)](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ms-computational-analysis-public-policy-mscapp)program, jointly led by the [Harris School of Public Policy](http://harris.uchicago.edu/) and the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.uchicago.edu/), are expected to have strong interest in the Fellows program given their commitment to bringing technology and data science to bear on public policy issues.

“This new program creates transformative opportunities for students across the university, in particular MSCAPP students who are already focused on finding solutions to policy problems through the use of data and technology,” said Jeff Jackson, assistant director, MSCAPP program. “The work extends the University’s commitment to leveraging data, civic engagement, and making a positive impact on the communities around campus.”

The Fellows program also calls for quarterly workshops that focus on further building organizations’ data and technology capacities and fostering community among organizations, as well as on soliciting feedback from organizations on how the work with students is impacting the communities they serve.

“The project will deepen and expand UChicago’s commitment to the Chicago community and promote a diverse and much needed pipeline of students to careers in public interest technology,” added Uminsky. It is projected that 3.5 million new data professionals in the social sector will be required over the next ten years, according to the recent Data.org “[Workforce Wanted: Data Talent for Social Impact](https://data.org/reports/workforce-wanted/)” report.

The Public Interest Technology University Network (PITUN), which was [convened in](https://www.fordfoundation.org/the-latest/news/higher-education-philanthropy-and-public-policy-sectors-unite-in-new-push-to-develop-public-interest-technology/) 2019 by the Ford Foundation, New America, and the Hewlett Foundation, is a partnership of colleges and universities dedicated to building the nascent field of public interest technology, as well as growing a new generation of civic-minded technologists and digitally fluent policy leaders. The Network Challenge is funded through the generous support of the Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard Impact Fund, Siegel Family Endowment, Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and Raikes Foundation.

The UChicago Data Science Institute is hiring a Community Data Fellows Program Manager to oversee this program. [Apply here](https://uchicago.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/External/job/Community-Data-Fellows-Program-Manager_JR19535) (EOE/Vet/Disability).

# Rethinking AI as a Thought Partner: Perspectives on Writing, Programming, and More

Exploring the Role of Bayesian Frameworks for Designing Complementary AI

Writing has always been a deeply human endeavor, reflecting our thoughts, beliefs, and creative processes. However, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) as a writing tool has challenged traditional understandings of authorship, cognition, and collaboration. In a recent perspective [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01991-9)), Assistant Professor [Mina Lee](https://minalee-research.github.io/research.html) from the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago and her collaborators at the University of Cambridge, Princeton University, New York University, The Alan Turing Institute, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explored the concept of AI as a “thought partner” rather than a tool.

The study presents a novel way to envision human-AI interaction, particularly in domains like storytelling, programming, medicine, and embodied assistance. The study emphasizes how AI could be designed explicitly to complement human reasoning, adapting dynamically to support users in more personalized and effective ways.

At the heart of this perspective is the Bayesian framework, a method that models human reasoning by starting with an initial belief (a prior) and refining it through new observations or data. Unlike traditional language models that rely on vast data to generalize behavior, Bayesian models explicitly account for uncertainty and variability in human thought. This allows AI systems to adjust to an individual user’s needs over time, learning from their behaviors, preferences, and constraints. For example, a Bayesian AI writing assistant could potentially rapidly adapt its suggestions based on whether the user is brainstorming, drafting, or revising their text, offering tailored support that aligns with their stage in the creative process and possibly do so in a more interpretable form. This contrasts with current systems, which often have a one-size-fits-all heuristic to decide when and how to provide suggestions, such as auto-completions that may disrupt rather than enhance the user experience and may lack interpretability and principled expression of uncertainty.

!

Assistant Professor Mina Lee

“We put forward an argument for what a good AI thought partner should have,” Lee stated. “This involves the three desiderata in the paper, which outlines that 1) the model should be able to understand us, 2) we can understand the model, and 3) we should have a shared understanding of the world. The Bayesian framework provides a nice method for us to do that systematically.”

Unlike tools, which assist with specific tasks in static and passive ways, humans engage with their partners dynamically and proactively, promoting collaborative modes of thinking. Drawing inspiration from human-to-human collaboration, the team identified key modes of collaborative thoughts that an AI thought partner could facilitate, such as sensemaking, deliberation, and ideation. These activities require AI systems to not only understand human reasoning but also make their own reasoning interpretable to users. Achieving this shared understanding is essential for fostering trust and efficiency in human-AI partnerships.

Lee and her collaborators introduced practical applications of this perspective across multiple domains. In programming, an AI thought partner could model a coder’s buggy mental model of the programming environment and interactively help to ‘patch’ bugs in their understanding. In storytelling, such a system could adapt its support to the writer’s needs while explicitly modeling the audience’s experience, refining its suggestions as the narrative evolves. Similarly, in the medical field, an AI thought partner could assist clinicians by accounting for their time constraints and diagnostic habits, selectively suggesting actions that enhance decision-making without overwhelming them with redundant information.

“We have limited time, limited memory, limited knowledge, and within those limited resources, we try to make rational decisions,” Lee stated.

“But it may not be optimal, right? That’s where the Bayesian framework shines,” Lee continued. “It allows AI systems to recognize and work within these human limitations, offering support that complements rather than competes with our cognitive processes. By modeling uncertainty and adapting iteratively, these systems can provide just-in-time assistance that aligns with how humans actually think and work. For example, consider a writer crafting a short story: a current AI system might suggest generic plot twists or character traits based on patterns in its training data, often interrupting the writer’s flow or proposing ideas that don’t fit the narrative’s tone. In contrast, a Bayesian AI thought partner could first infer the writer’s intent—whether they are exploring possibilities, refining a plotline, or polishing language—and adapt its suggestions accordingly. It might help brainstorm unconventional twists during the ideation phase, ask clarifying questions when the narrative is ambiguous, or propose subtle linguistic refinements when the story nears completion. This nuanced support fosters creativity without disrupting the writer’s process.”

Despite the promising potential of AI thought partners, Lee acknowledged the challenges and ethical considerations of integrating these systems into everyday tasks. One critical area of exploration is how AI thought partners might shape user cognition and behavior. For instance, while a Bayesian AI system could support students by adapting its feedback to their unique learning styles or helping them tackle complex problems, it also raises concerns about overreliance.

“AI has the potential to augment human thinking, but it must do so without diminishing our capacity for creativity and critical thinking,” Lee emphasized.

This tension is particularly pronounced in educational settings, where some educators worry that AI systems might bypass essential skill development, while others see them as opportunities to foster innovation and efficiency. By designing systems that encourage synergistic collaboration, the researchers hope to strike a balance, ensuring that AI thought partners complement human cognition without replacing it. This approach highlights the importance of aligning AI design with broader societal goals, ensuring that these systems serve as tools for empowerment rather than dependency.

Looking forward, Lee and her students have many exciting projects planned to dive deeper into the intersection of writing and AI. One project focuses on investigating how AI will transform writing education and how to create a curriculum that incorporates AI tools. Another plan is to study how users’ capacity for creativity and critical thinking is impacted by AI.

# Sixteen UChicago faculty members receive named, distinguished service professorships

Including DSI's very own Michael Franklin and Dan Nicolae

Sixteen University of Chicago faculty members have received distinguished service professorships or named professorships.

Profs. Michael Franklin, Chang-Tai Hsieh, Dan Nicolae, Lubos Pastor, Robert Shimer and Lisa Wedeen have been named distinguished service professors. Profs. Scott Ashworth, Orit Bashkin, William Baude, Sarah Hammerschlag, Julia R. Henly, William Hubbard, Jonathan Lyon, Jennifer Nou, C. Riley Snorton and Tara Zahra have received named professorships.

All appointments were effective July 1, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

## Division of the Humanities

**Orit Bashkin** has been named the Mabel Greene Myers Professor in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and the College.

As a historian specializing on the intellectual, social and cultural history of the modern Middle East, Bashkin delves into Iraqi history, the history of Iraqi Jews, the Arab cultural revival movement in the late 19th-century, and the connections between modern Arab history and Arabic literature. Her most recent books include the edited volume “Jews and Journeys: Travel and Performance of Jewish Identity” (2021), which was co-authored with Joshua Levinson; and “Impossible Exodus: Iraqi Jews in Israel” (2017), which received the 2018 Nikki Keddie Book Award from the Middle East Studies Association.

Recently, Bashkin received a Guggenheim Fellowship to support a book project on the history of Middle Eastern Jews from the early-modern to modern period. Drawing from Arabic, Judeo-Arabic and Hebrew sources, she will show how Jews remembered and understood Ottoman and Arab politics through contemporary and biblical narratives. Through her scholarship, Bashkin has excelled at discovering lesser-known communities in the Middle East and describing their remarkable histories.

**C. Riley Snorton** has been named the Mary R. Morton Professor in the Departments of English Language and Literature, of Race, Diaspora and Indigeneity, and the College.

A Black and transgender cultural theorist, his research draws from Black studies, queer theory and trans theory, seeking to complicate and expand those histories through the creation of a new vocabulary. His award-winning book “Black on Both Sides: A Racial History of Trans Identity” (2017) was the first publication to weave together the study of race and transgender identity, exploring those intersections from the 19th century to the present. Among the book’s awards are the William Sanders Scarborough Prize from the Modern Language Association, the John Boswell Prize from the American Historical Association, the Lamba Literary Award for Transgender Nonfiction and the Sylvia Rivera Award in Transgender Studies from the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies.

Snorton’s first book “Nobody Is Supposed to Know” (2014) examines how negative perceptions of Black sexuality are reinforced by media and pop culture portrayals of the “down low”—Black men who have sex with men without identifying as gay, queer or bisexual. His next monograph, tentatively titled “Mud: Ecologies of Racial Meaning,” looks at the pervasive presence of swamps to racial practices and formations in the Americas. He is the co-editor of GLQ: A Journal of Gay and Lesbian Studies.

# Students Ranya Sharma and Jaleel Drones-Akins Return to DSI For 2022 Summer Lab

!

The educational mission of the Data Science Institute is to create an accessible pipeline for students interested in a data science career, building a diverse and passionate future generation of data scientists. This summer, high school students Ranya Sharma and Jaleel Drones-Akins exemplify those efforts by participating in the DSI Summer Lab, their second time in a DSI program.

Sharma, a recent graduate of Barrington High School in suburban Chicago and incoming freshman at UChicago, is in her second year of Summer Lab, conducting research with the [Internet Equity Initiative](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/) and DSI faculty director of research [Nick Feamster](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/). Drones-Akins, a senior at Kenwood Academy, joined Summer Lab after completing [the first edition](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/first-ever-data4all-workshop-nurtures-future-data-scientists-from-chicagos-south-side/) of the [Data4All Workshop](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/engage/data4all/) in 2021, and works on a project team from the social impact track overseen by DSI data scientist Daniel Grzenda.

Both students said that Summer Lab has given them valuable research experience and improved their data science skills.

“I always knew that I wanted to study computer science, since the end of my sophomore year of high school,” Sharma said. “But I never really had experience in it, except for in a classroom setting. So I wanted to fully dive in deep as to what people do in computer science beyond basic coding classes.”

“It has advanced my interest in data science and computer science in general,” said Drones-Akins. “I came into the program, and I thought I knew so much. And then once I got here, I thought, ‘OK, there are a lot of things that I didn’t know about.’ I feel like with that knowledge now, the program has prepared me more for what’s to come in the future.”

!In Data4All, Drones-Akins was part of a cohort of South Side high school students that learned about the power of data to answer important questions in science and society and bring about positive change. With faculty, students, and researchers from UChicago, Argonne, and Fermilab, the students applied their new knowledge in group projects using real COVID-19 data, studying the effects of the pandemic across Chicago neighborhoods and demographic groups.

Drones-Akins credits the workshop with introducing him to using the Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks, skills that he uses frequently in Summer Lab. This summer, he’s part of a team working with partner organization and [11th Hour Project](https://11thhourproject.org/) grantee [Remora Fishing Traceability](https://www.remoraxyz.com/) on their “Smart Scale” technology that uses computer vision and deep learning to estimate the weight of fish caught at small fisheries.

“Having the knowledge of how to work with those tools definitely prepared me for the project that I’m working on,” Drones-Akins said. “I’m actually able to do research now, whereas Data4All felt like a prep for this summer – it was a really good prep, because it taught me essential skills. Summer Lab is definitely more hands-on with the research, and I love that.”

!Sharma is spending her second consecutive summer working with Feamster, who studies internet network reliability, security, and privacy. Last year, her work on encrypted DNS resolvers led to a paper submission, and she’s continuing that study this summer while also working on data analysis and visualization for the Internet Equity Initiative’s [household internet measurement study](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/about/internet-study/). Not only did Sharma return for a second round of Summer Lab, she also will join University of Chicago as an undergraduate this fall.

“I had a very positive experience, I felt like my work was valued,” Sharma said. “It’s an environment where there are many people to support you, and you have the best resources at your fingertips.”

Both students said they saw themselves pursuing a future in computer or data science, and that Summer Lab had opened their eyes to the wide variety of career options in those fields.

“I’m hoping to do my undergraduate studies in computer science, and maybe after that I’m interested in potentially going to law school to further study the intersection between computer science, technology, public policy and law,” Sharma said. “Before coming to Summer Lab, I didn’t know if there were even careers in technology and law. But when I came here I found a community of people doing that same work. So you feel supported with a group of people who are interested and are successful in the same domain that you’re interested in. If it wasn’t for Summer Lab, I’m not sure if I would have been so sure about pursuing computer science, it has really just dramatically increased my passion for this area.”

# UChicago Graduate Students Contribute Data Skills to Nonprofits

Graduate students in the DSI’s Community Data Fellows program make an impact by working on capacity-building data projects for local civic organizations.

Community Data Fellows spent their Autumn months working closely with staff from local nonprofits and government agencies, including South Side-based Praize Productions, Inc.,  the Illinois Commission on Equity and Inclusion, and others, to build long-term, community-centric data solutions. Now in its second year, the Community Data Fellows program is an important part of the Data Science Institute’s commitment to data science for social impact. 

The Community Data Fellows program was originally launched as a pilot program in January 2022. Shortly afterwards, the program was expanded in Spring 2023 through grant funding by the [Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN)](https://www.newamerica.org/pit/), a partnership of universities dedicated to combining public policy and digital innovation for societal benefit. 

> “I recommend this program as it exposes students to experiences much closer to what one can find in the professional field.”
>
> – Manuel Mendez (MSCAPP ‘24)

As Community Data Fellows, UChicago graduate students work on data-related projects for community and civic organizations. They collaborate with the organizations to identify their data science needs and goals, develop project plans, and create deliverables to help them improve their outreach and impact. Autumn 2023 Fellows from multiple degree programs worked on a wide range of social impact projects for organizations focused on topics such as supporting public education, performing arts, and climate change solutions.

EDUCATION

Manuel Mendez (MSCAPP ‘24) worked on a large-scale data cleaning project for the education policy organization [Kids First Chicago](https://kidsfirstchicago.org/). Mendez transformed, cleaned, and filtered multiple large public datasets for Kids First Chicago to use in future projects. This data will help Kids First Chicago continue in their mission to improve K-12 education in Chicago by partnering with Black and Latine parents for resources, access, and advocacy. 

DIGITAL EQUITY

Santiago Segovia Baquero (MSCAPP ‘24) and Stephania Tello Zamudio (MSCAPP ‘24) created an interactive geospatial visualization for the [Internet Equity Initiative](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/) at the Data Science Institute. Segovia’s and Tello’s project illustrates the locations and broadband Internet access options of local Illinois public libraries. These anchor institutions are often key for residents’ Internet access, so the Internet Equity Initiative needed a way to visualize the distribution and broadband access of public libraries. This map will help inform IEI’s future research and policy work to expand broadband Internet access across the United States. 

PERFORMING ARTS

The Chicago dance and arts organization [Praize Productions, Inc.](https://www.praizeproductions.com/) worked with Athmika Senthilkumar (MPP ‘25). Senthilkumar created a robust analysis of Praize Production, Inc.’s impact in the Chicago performing arts sphere, demonstrating their important role in the South Side dance community. Praize Productions, Inc. will use Senthilkumar’s work to learn more about their audiences and funders in the future, as they work to bring dance opportunities to Chicago families and performers. 

CLIMATE and AGRICULTURE

Josemaria Macedo (MSCAPP ‘24) continued his previous work as a Summer ‘23 Community Data Fellow with the climate and agricultural focused organizations [FracTracker](https://www.fractracker.org/) and [Oakland Institute](https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/). For Oakland Institute, Macedo cleaned, grouped, aggregated, and visualized data about grain exports to Ukraine, India, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. This information will help Oakland Institute study agricultural land concentration and increase transparency about our global agricultural supply chains. For FracTracker, Macedo  worked to create webforms for multiple U.S. states’ environmental agencies. These webforms help community members track and report environmental concerns caused by oil and gas development, and provide a quick and easy place for residents to contact their local environmental agency for further investigation. 

FINANCIAL INCLUSION

Daniel Posmik (GSAL ‘24) built upon work that previous Community Data Fellows created for the [State of Illinois Commission on Equity and Inclusion](https://cei.illinois.gov/). Posmik created an interactive visualization that illustrates the locations and certification types of businesses participating in the Commission’s Business Enterprise Program. This visualization will assist Commission staff in demonstrating the wide-reaching impact of their work as they continue to support women-, veteran-, and minority-owned businesses across Illinois and beyond. 

WHAT’S NEXT

“We’re so excited to see this program continue to benefit students and organizational partners for the Winter 2024 quarter,” says Ari Zickau, Community Data Fellows Program Manager. “We had a record number of student applications for Winter 2024, which just shows how eager UChicago students are to contribute their data science and technical skills to their community.” Fellows in the Winter Quarter are partnering with journalism, health, and digital equity organizations on data analysis projects. Nonprofits and civic organizations who are interested in completing short-term data projects are invited to [partner with Community Data Fellows](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/community-data-fellows/program-details/partners/) and build long-lasting relationships that benefit our unique Chicago and Illinois communities.

# UChicago Researchers Receive Grants to Apply Computational Techniques to COVID Fight

The c3.ai Digital Transformation Institute awarded grants to three new projects with University of Chicago researchers that will use machine learning, agent-based modeling, and other approaches to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has mobilized the world’s scientific community like no other recent crisis, including many researchers using the most modern data science and artificial intelligence approaches. At the University of Chicago, public health experts, computer scientists, economists and policy analysts have launched projects using computational tools to better detect, diagnose, treat and prevent the spread of the deadly virus.

This summer, three of these projects received seed funding from the [C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute (DTI)](http://c3dti.ai), a new partnership of technology companies and universities committed to accelerating the benefits of artificial intelligence for business, government and society. The research attacks the pandemic from several angles: helping policymakers control disease spread by identifying and addressing key social factors, physicians detect the disease at earlier stages, and hospitals decide which patients require admission. A fourth project, [a collaboration led by UChicago Medicine’s Maryellen Giger](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/researchers-develop-ai-help-diagnose-understand-covid-19-lung-images), was funded by the organization in spring.

The awards were part of $5.4 million in funding distributed by DTI, after [their inaugural call for proposals in March](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/uchicago-joins-new-academicindustry-consortium-accelerate-ai-innovation). The group also provides AI software tools and a “data lake” of COVID-19 datasets to aid researchers studying the pandemic.

“The enthusiastic response among scientists and researchers coupled with the diverse, high-quality and compelling proposals we’ve received suggests that we have the potential to alter the course of this global pandemic,” said Thomas M. Siebel, CEO of C3.ai. “In the face of this crisis, the Institute is proud to bring together the best and brightest minds and provide direction and leadership to support objective analysis and AI-based, data-driven science to mitigate COVID-19.”

**Modeling health disparities**

The early toll of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed severe health inequities in who catches the disease and who suffers death and morbidity. Latin and African Americans are more than three times as likely to catch the virus and twice as likely to die as white Americans, [according to CDC data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html). Many experts believe this disparity goes beyond medical comorbidities, to social determinants such as housing, jobs and neighborhood features.

[Anna Hotton](http://med-faculty.bsd.uchicago.edu/Default/Details/16813), a research assistant professor at UChicago Medicine, previously studied the relationship between social factors and viral spread in the context of other infectious diseases. With her DTI grant, she’s working with fellow UChicago researchers [Aditya Khanna](http://home.uchicago.edu/khanna7/about.html), [Harold Pollack](https://ssa.uchicago.edu/ssascholars/h-pollack) and [John Schneider](https://pbhs.uchicago.edu/program/faculty/john-schneider) to adapt that work to COVID-19, with help from agent-based modeling experts [Jonathan Ozik](https://www.anl.gov/profile/jonathan-ozik) and [Charles Macal](https://www.anl.gov/profile/charles-m-macal) at Argonne National Laboratory.

“A lot of my substantive work focuses around understanding social and structural factors as they impact HIV transmission,” Hotton said. “With COVID-19, there are a lot of similarities in terms of the social factors that shape people’s vulnerability to infection, and I’m motivated to shed light on some of these social issues and help guide work around reducing health inequities.”

Agent-based modeling is a powerful form of computer simulation for studying complex systems, from molecular interactions to traffic congestion. Over the last decade, Argonne researchers Ozik and Macal have gradually assembled a computer model for the entire city of Chicago and its population, using it to observe and predict the spread of diseases both real (MRSA, influenza) and imagined ([a zombie outbreak](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/blue-sky/ct-argonne-zombie-takeover-argonne-bsi-20161031-story.html)). Recently, the team has [focused their ChiSIM model on the spread of COVID-19](https://www.anl.gov/article/argonnes-researchers-and-facilities-playing-a-key-role-in-the-fight-against-covid19?utm_source=Argonne+Internal+List&utm_campaign=d34b8b7d6f-Snapshot_2020_03_30&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_91cdd2aa04-d34b8b7d6f-237434281), looking for types of buildings and areas of the city where people gather and disease transmission risk is high.

With Hotton and her collaborators, Ozik and Macal are working on adding new data to their synthetic Chicago population of 2.7 million “agents,” including information on housing, occupations and other social determinants that likely influence virus spread. The team will also use machine learning to identify the data elements that are most important to include in the model from a long list of options, such as time spent on public transit, ability to work from home, number of family members in a household, and many other details.

Once enriched with this data, the researchers will be able to better simulate various scenarios of disease spread and virtually test how different public health or social policy strategies can help mitigate the disease. Their results will be shared with partners in the Chicago and Illinois Departments of Public Health, advising these agencies on how best to deploy testing, reopening of businesses and schools, and, eventually, vaccination.

“Agent-based modeling allows us to explore intervention approaches in a virtual environment before rolling out interventions in real life, in addition to making predictions about trends in incidence and mortality,” Hotton said. “Later, when vaccines are available, we’ll need to figure out how to deploy them most efficiently to the populations with greatest need.”

**Admit or Release?**

One of the toughest decisions physicians face during the pandemic is deciding which COVID-19 patients to keep in the hospital, and which are safe to recover at home. In the face of overwhelmed hospital capacity and a brand-new disease with little data-based evidence for diagnosis and treatment, old rubrics for deciding which patients to admit have proven ineffective. But machine learning could help make the right decision earlier, saving lives and lowering healthcare costs.

A team led by Prof. [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/m/sendhil-mullainathan) of Chicago Booth will work with a large northwest U.S. hospital network on creating a new model for predicting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe symptom and primary cause of death for COVID-19 patients. Using over 4 million chest X-rays, the team—which also includes [Aleksander Madry](https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/) of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and [Ziad Obermeyer](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/ziad-obermeyer/) from University of California, Berkeley—will build a new machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of this pulmonary collapse.

To work around the issue of limited COVID-19 data early in the pandemic, the team will feed their model with X-rays from other conditions that affect the lungs, such as influenza and pneumonia.

“No one has enough data on COVID yet to apply the modern machine learning toolkit,” said Obermeyer. “But in a pulmonary infection such as COVID, the lungs actually have a very limited physiological playbook. When the lungs are attacked by a virus or bacterium, they basically only react in one way. Our hypothesis is that we can learn about deterioration in COVID by looking at deterioration in other conditions.”

Once validated, their AI model will be made open source and available to other health systems around the world. The project also allows Mullainathan and Obermeyer an opportunity to develop a medical decision-making algorithm that controls for the bias they identified in other healthcare software in [previous research](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/health-care-prediction-algorithm-biased-against-black-patients-study-finds).

“Even if you’re using objective biological data like X-rays, your outcomes are biased because they’re produced by a health system that is biased,” Obermeyer said. “The optimistic view of our prior work on racial bias is that once you’re aware of those biases, you can make algorithms that take them into account.”

**Early Detection: Treating a Pandemic Like Engine Failure**

In the early stages of a disease outbreak, detecting cases is critical to prevent population spread, but also very difficult—a proverbial “needle in the haystack” data problem. But computer scientists have already developed artificial intelligence systems for such challenges in other contexts, such as detecting mechanical faults in jet engines or anomalous and potentially fraudulent financial transactions. Models built for these applications must be able to accurately and reliably find rare occurrences in a flood of data—nobody wants to discover airplane engine failure too late.

In previous work at Caltech, UChicago computer scientist [Yuxin Chen](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/yuxin-chen1/) built these early detection systems for mechanical engineers and other domain experts. With DTI funding, he’ll work with researchers from UC Berkeley and UCSF on transferring these approaches to detecting infection from COVID and other diseases using medical and public health surveillance data. The team will adapt solutions for common challenges such as training models on sparse data, combining data from different sources and collection techniques, and minimizing false negatives that could have dire consequences if infected patients are missed.

Chen’s portion of the project focuses on his primary research interest: [interactive machine learning](https://cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/yuxin-chen-profile/). As opposed to the passive, “black box” of most AI models, these systems actively work with human experts, suggesting new data sources that should be gathered to improve predictions, or asking for help when a particular diagnosis is unclear.

“If the model is not very confident about the predictive results for a certain medical diagnosis that we have data on, it will flag these data and ask experts to verify or correct the predictive results,” said Chen, an assistant professor. “We also care about interpretable recommendations; we’re training our AI system to effectively communicate with the human users to collaboratively make detection and diagnosis decisions. So we need to build an interpretable interface that sits between the system and medical professionals in order to make the collaboration seamless.”

# UIC CS graduate, headed into career and graduate school, reflects on experience at DSI

Republished from the University of Illinois Chicago, computer science undergraduate Salvador Tranquilino–Ramos reflects on his experience at the Data Science Institute's summer program

!

This May, UIC student Salvador Tranquilino–Ramos graduated with a bachelor’s degree in data science and is poised to begin UIUC’s Online Master of Computer Science in Data Science degree while also starting a full time position with the online reservation platform Tock.  [In an article](https://cs.uic.edu/news-stories/cs-graduate-headed-into-career-and-graduate-school/) from UIC’s computer science department, Tranquilino–Ramos credits part of his success to his experiences with the University of Chicago’s Data Science Institute as part of the [Data Science Social Impact Summer Program](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/data-science-for-social-impact-network/).

Tranquilino–Ramos worked with DSI software engineer [Launa Greer](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/launa-greer/) on a project for WoMin, a grantee of [the 11th Hour Project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/11th-hour-project/). “Development projects often have negative externalities like deforestation, air pollution, or water contamination.  These costs are not borne by the project’s managers and financial lenders, but indirectly by surrounding communities, who suffer adverse health outcomes and damaged agricultural economies in the absence of stronger regulation,” explained Greer. “In 2022, my DSI Summer Lab team worked with the South African-based nonprofit WoMin, which advocates for development project reform, to investigate the extent to which certain types of development sites, like coal mines, could be considered pollution sources.”

At the end of the program, Tranquilino–Ramos asked to continue working on the project through an independent study course and explore machine learning techniques to answer the team’s research question. His course advisor and Greer scoped the project to a related and well-studied, real-world problem that could be accomplished within a single academic semester: predicting the location of wildfires, which are also more common with deforestation. They chose to focus on one country, Uganda, whose government was actively debating how to allocate resources to address a recent increase in wildfires. Over the course of the academic term, Tranquilino–Ramos wrote a data pipeline to fetch fire locations predicted by NASA satellite imagery, clean and normalize those datasets, and then train a random forest regression model to predict the number of fires that would occur in a Ugandan county on a given day based on *N* previous days of data.

Greer stated that it was a pleasure to watch Tranquilino–Ramos pick up new skills in Python scripting, version control,  API consumption, and the general data science lifecycle. “It’s so rewarding to see students then transfer those skills to the workplace or catch a spark that leads them to apply for graduate school,” said Greer. “I’m excited to see what he does next!”

Here’s an except from UIC’s story:

After a college career filled with internships, undergraduate research, and student teaching – all while maintaining a 4.0 grade point average–Salvador Tranquilino – Ramos graduated in May from UIC with a bachelor’s degree in data science.

…

After his first year at UIC, Tranquilino-Ramos interned at the University of Chicago’s Data Science Institute as a research assistant intern. He worked with a Uganda-based nonprofit organization on a data science project, creating a database and website to track their work more effectively, replacing their previous system of Word documents and Excel spreadsheets. When his internship ended, Tranquilino-Ramos wanted to continue his work with the group, so he enrolled in CS 398, Undergraduate Design/Research, and continued his work with Clinical Associate Professor Gonzalo Bello and the University of Chicago team.

“We extended the project into not only storing information, but created a machine-learning algorithm that was able to predict fires in Uganda,” Tranquilino-Ramos said.

He went on to work with Assistant Professor Stavros Sintos on geometrical computational programs. Their aim was to improve Google search algorithms by making them fair, diverse, and random.

This summer, Tranquilino-Ramos will join the online reservation platform Tock, where he interned last summer as a software engineer with the front-of-house team, creating tools for restaurant owners and hosts. He received a return offer last August.

…

Tranquilino-Ramos has a piece of advice for incoming students:

“Talk to your professors; they are the first people you can contact if you’re looking for an opportunity,” Tranquilino-Ramos said. “If I hadn’t expressed my interest in data science to Professor Bello, I wouldn’t have obtained that first University of Chicago internship.”

# Unique data science partnership with City Colleges of Chicago offers rising professors, and their students, a more inclusive learning experience

!

Amanda Kube Jotte says participating in the University of Chicago and City Colleges of Chicago Data Science Preceptorship Program has made her a better teacher in countless ways. The joint program’s unique structure that places recent Ph.D. graduates like her in teaching roles at both UChicago and City Colleges helped her develop newfound confidence in the classroom and learn the most effective ways to make data science resonate with a diverse swath of students. It’s only fitting, she says, as the emerging field of data science—and the burgeoning data science ecosystem UChicago and other institutions are helping to build in the region—relies on incorporating as many voices as possible.

“Data science is meant to be very collaborative,” Kube Jotte, who taught data science courses at both UChicago and City Colleges’ Harry S. Truman College and will be starting a full-time role as an instructional professor at UChicago this fall, said. “Having more perspectives is extremely useful in a field where what you are doing is meant to then be applied. When you are working on something that’s going to be implemented on the South Side of Chicago, for instance, it’s important to have people who understand the South Side, who live there, giving input, because they’re the ones who are going to know exactly what is needed in their community.”

Instead of a traditional post-doc experience that focuses on research, preceptors spend the majority of their time focused on developing as teachers. While a few other universities have teaching-focused preceptor programs, UChicago and City Colleges’ dual-placement structure is unique. The design came about in part as a way to leverage UChicago’s data science resources to help City Colleges build out their own data science curriculum while also offering the preceptors, and in turn their students, a more enriching learning experience.  So far, five preceptors have participated across four City Colleges’ campuses with three new participants lined up for the coming year. 

**A broader STEM commitment**

The Preceptorship Program began in 2022 as part of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the University and City Colleges. The partnership aims to strengthen STEM education and career opportunities and create a more diverse field of professionals entering the sciences.

“The MOU with the University of Chicago establishes a robust and flexible framework for partnerships, such as our collaboration with the Data Science Institute,” said Mark Potter, Provost and Chief Academic Officer at City Colleges of Chicago. “This agreement facilitates navigation through both institutions’ systems, fostering innovative initiatives that drive growth and excellence. It opens doors for collaborative efforts, ensuring that both institutions benefit from shared expertise and resources, paving the way for advancements in education and research.”

At UChicago, the program also advances the Inclusive Innovation Initiative, a joint effort between UChicago, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory that is engaging local students, educators, and workers and connecting them to that growing scientific ecosystem in Chicago, making it more reflective of the city itself and spurring economic growth on the historically under-resourced South Side.

**Building collaborative capacity**

Because data science as a field is still in its early stages, finding qualified instructors can be difficult, particularly at a community college.

“For City Colleges, and community colleges in general, what makes this partnership really exciting is as community colleges are staying at the forefront especially in the STEM industries that are changing really fast, finding capacity to build programs and teach in those programs takes a lot of time, so when you have a partner like UChicago who has the capacity to partner with us and who’s in all the conversations in those industries, it helps us build and innovate in a way that often is really hard to do,” City Colleges professor Kate Connor said.

The set-up—which also includes crossovers like UChicago reserving slots for City Colleges students in their summer programs—has proven to be so novel several other institutions have approached UChicago and City Colleges about how they can replicate it on their own campuses.

**Shaping new approaches to teaching**

At UChicago, preceptors work closely with faculty mentors, attend workshops with the University’s Center for Teaching and Learning, and support a variety of summer clinics and programs. At City Colleges, program participants are enrolled in a customized two-year version of the institution’s professional development sequence for tenure-track faculty that includes syllabus and assessment design, classroom observations, and an overall honing of their personal teaching philosophy. Preparing to teach students coming from a variety of backgrounds and experience levels makes up a significant element of the training as well.

“When we started the Data Science Institute in 2021, our goal wasn’t just to help UChicago students. You’re building a new field and the more inclusive you make the foundations, the better it’s going to be,” said David Uminsky, Executive Director of UChicago’s Data Science Institute. “The Preceptor Program has been a collaborative and mutually beneficial partnership from the start. With faculty mentorship at both City Colleges and UChicago and specialized training from City Colleges, preceptors are learning inclusive best practices, gaining an understanding of student support services, and developing a reflective practice for teaching.”

“It’s extremely valuable to experience a different student population. We have a really fascinating mix of students from all over the world. We have CPS grads, we have older students, and parents, and lots of students who come here to save money before they transfer to a four-year school, and I think some of the teaching methods that we tend to rely on as faculty members when dealing with fairly elite groups of students aren’t as effective when you have such diversity in the classroom,” Truman College Professor Anne Close, who leads the modified tenure-track program, said. “We encourage our faculty to think more as collaborators in learning instead of just experts who are imparting their knowledge to students who are ideally prepared to receive it.”

Preceptor Bill Trok, who just completed his first year in the program, says he found thinking deeply about things like syllabus design and different student needs in the City Colleges’ professional development sequence to be especially valuable. Trok has also been the only preceptor so far who has taught at Chicago State University in South Shore in addition to his courses at UChicago and City Colleges as UChicago looks to further expand the program’s impact and reach. Trok found his students represented a wide spectrum—from UChicago students who lived on campus and were solely focused on their studies to City College students who were new to the material to a 67-year-old Chicago State grandmother who’d returned to school to finish her degree.

“It makes you a better teacher in so many ways,” he says.

**Scaling impact**

Beyond partnering with additional institutions like Chicago State, program leaders at both UChicago and City Colleges look forward to the growing preceptor program being more widely seen as a case study for the intersectional impact this type of collaboration can continue to create.

“The magic of this program has been that everybody has benefitted,” City Colleges’ Connor says. “There has been a lot of mutual respect and collaboration and honoring that there’s a lot of knowledge we all bring to the table that has been really exciting to be a part of.”

# University of Chicago, City Colleges of Chicago Join Forces to Increase Diversity in Science Careers

The Data Science Institute is part of a new institutional partnership between UChicago and CCC to strengthen STEM education and career opportunities and create a more diverse field of professionals entering the sciences

City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) and the University of Chicago (UChicago) are joining forces at an institutional level to strengthen STEM education and career opportunities and create a more diverse field of professionals entering the sciences.

A Memorandum of Understanding executed by the two institutions aims to ensure that innovation in the rapidly changing fields of science and technology benefits from a wide range of perspectives and experiences.

A CCC data science degree program and [a preceptorship program](https://apply.interfolio.com/100139) with the Data Science Institute are among the first initiatives being developed from the collaboration.

Established as a strategic CCC growth priority based on input from industry leaders, the program will reflect the knowledge and expertise of both UChicago and City Colleges faculty.

While the number of STEM degrees awarded nationally has grown in recent years, diversity among degree earners has lagged. According to a Pew Research Center analysis, in 2018, Latinx students earned 12% of the bachelor’s degrees awarded in the United States in STEM fields, and Black students earned just 7%. The same analysis found that in graduate programs in these fields Black students were still underrepresented. At U.S. academic institutions in 2019, Black students made up just 6.8% of all enrollees in master’s degree programs, 3.7% of all doctoral programs, and just 1.6% of postdoctoral researchers in science, engineering, and health fields.

The new institutional partnership builds on existing initiatives designed to increase the number of City Colleges students earning degrees in the sciences and advancing into STEM fields. A [molecular engineering course](https://pme.uchicago.edu/news/pritzker-molecular-engineering-course-offers-stem-pathway-city-colleges-students) at UChicago’s [Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering](https://pme.uchicago.edu/) (PME) taught exclusively for CCC students, for instance, was designed to open pathways for those students to transfer into four-year STEM degree programs.

UChicago President, Paul Alivisatos highlighted the importance of diverse perspectives and partnerships during his October inauguration, calling diversity “the practical key to understanding the world around us, and to solving problems to the benefit of our society.”

The new UChicago-CCC agreement, Alivisatos said, is a critical mechanism for achieving that scope of thought. The partnership “provides an opportunity for us to deepen our engagement with more students across Chicago and to create more pathways for them into STEM careers,” he said. “Our commitment to inquiry and innovation inspires us to help strengthen these fields by expanding the breadth of scholarly perspectives that advance them.”

“This relationship is about harnessing two of our city’s higher education assets to create unprecedented opportunities and, ultimately, a more inclusive economy,” said City Colleges of Chicago Chancellor Juan Salgado. “With this collaboration agreement, we increase our capacity as an institution to be responsive to our community. We’ll not only create new pathways and internship opportunities for our students, but we’ll also build a pipeline of educators prepared to teach in new and emerging STEM fields. It promises to be transformative not only for our students but for our faculty — and for the students and faculty of the University of Chicago as well.”

“Our future truly lies in those studying and working in STEM fields, so it’s important that this field represent diverse perspectives,” said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. “I am thrilled to see two of our city’s important institutions come together to strengthen and expand opportunities in this industry. The UChicago-CCC collaboration will empower the next generation of scholars and professionals and strengthen our city’s standing as a global destination for innovation in the sciences.”

“As a scientist and early advocate of diversity in STEM, I am very proud to see UChicago and City Colleges working together to inspire and prepare Chicago students, especially those historically underrepresented in STEM, to launch transformative careers,” said Walter E. Massey, City Colleges of Chicago Board Chair.

To generate new opportunities for collaboration between City Colleges and UChicago, academic and administrative representatives from each institution will serve on a leadership committee and convene annually with the President and Chancellor to advance innovative initiatives.

The institutions will collaborate on new projects, with a focus on four key areas of partnership.

* **Education**: UChicago faculty and staff will advise CCC on curriculum and academic program design in the sciences, and the two institutions will collaborate on creating fellowships, internships, and other programs to bring CCC students to the UChicago campus and vice versa.
* **Research:** UChicago and CCC faculty will collaborate on faculty-led research initiatives and share any findings that collaboration generates.
* **Employment pathways:** Together, UChicago and CCC will develop new programs and grow existing ones to increase the number of science-focused internships, apprenticeships, and certificate programs available to CCC students.
* **Civic engagement:** UChicago and CCC will collaborate on ways to engage both institutions’ students in the full range of educational opportunities they offer and to advance inclusive innovation in higher education and the sciences.

The collaboration agreement aims to widen the partnership over time by identifying, creating, and accelerating new joint initiatives focused on research and education opportunities for students and faculty in the sciences — including the physical, social, and biological sciences.

## **New degree programs in growing fields**

One challenge for the relatively new data science field is that programs face a shortage of faculty trained to teach the subject. To address the issue, UChicago and CCC collaborated on an innovative solution that benefits faculty and students at both institutions: a teaching fellowship that will provide recent Ph.D. graduates in data science, mathematics, statistics, computer science, and other STEM fields with mentorship and teaching instruction as preparation for dual teaching appointments at the University and CCC.

[*Apply here for the UChicago/CCC Data Science Preceptorship Program*](https://apply.interfolio.com/100139).

As CCC works to build new degree programs in the sciences, the fellowship will help the institutions concurrently build a pipeline of instructors to teach in these programs. In the program’s first year, two to three fellows will be hired to start teaching at the beginning of the 2022–23 academic year.

“A strong understanding of data science will be essential across countless fields in the coming years and this collaboration will ensure our next generation of data scientists will not only be able to analyze and apply data but also incorporate new perspectives and lived experience into solving critical real-world problems,” said Angela V. Olinto, Dean of the Physical Sciences Division at UChicago.

Developing new programs is the start of an effort that both institutions plan to eventually expand into disciplines such as quantum science and engineering and the physical, social, and biological sciences.

# Victor Veitch, First UChicago Data Science Faculty, Builds “Safe and Credible” AI Systems

The new assistant professor in the Department of Statistics combines causal inference and machine learning to build AI systems that align with human values.

Machine learning has made dramatic strides on several tasks that were once the exclusive territory of the human mind. In many areas, neural networks and other ML approaches can identify images, make predictions and decisions, and generate realistic language with the same accuracy — or better — than humans. But often these systems arrive at their outputs through logic that humans would find bizarre…if you can even tell how they reached those conclusions at all.

[Victor Veitch](http://victorveitch.com/), a new assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu/) and the first faculty hire in the University of Chicago’s new data science initiative, wants to see a future of “safe and credible” artificial intelligence. In order to realize that vision, he’s interested in revising the foundations of machine learning so that models work in ways more palatable to humans and human values, instead of today’s black boxes and non-sequitur logic.

That research involves studying the intersection of causal inference and machine learning — encompassing, Veitch says, both “causality for machine learning” and “machine learning for causality.

“All applied problems in data science are problems of causal inference,” Veitch said. “What people really want to know is, what is going to happen in the world if I do X? It’s not enough to just say, what’s the correlation or what prediction can I make here; you actually want to answer questions about if I do this, what’s going to happen?”

The interest is the latest in Veitch’s mercurial career path thus far, which has run from theoretical physics to quantum computing to statistical foundations as he has moved between the Universities of Waterloo and Toronto and Columbia University. His new position at the University of Chicago will also be split with a continuing role at Google Cambridge, where he works with their causality group.

That broad experience gives Veitch a fresh perspective in the very crowded research area of machine learning. The physics and statistics background gave him the strength to understand and improve the mathematical structure of deep learning systems, while his interests in effective altruism encouraged him to focus on expanding and refining the potential of machine learning, an “important and beautiful” subject.

“There’s an overall compelling argument that one of the things that humanity as a whole should care a lot about is making AI systems that align well with human values and behave in the ways that we want them to behave,” Veitch said. “I think it is one of the most important problems facing humanity today.”

Thus far, his research has focused on improving machine learning pipelines to estimate causal effects, rather than merely making “black box” predictions that don’t explain why a particular outcome is expected. Moving ML in this direction will be especially useful for fields such as medicine and epidemiology, which seek to know more about the effectiveness of treatments or the health effects of exposure to pollution. Veitch is also interested in adapting these causal pipelines for images and text, where neural networks show tremendous advantages over traditional statistical techniques.

That research has led him to unique collaborations such as work with [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/), a non-profit organization that provides mental health crisis counseling via text messages. By analyzing transcripts of text conversations with causal machine learning, the researchers could find which approaches are most effective in helping individuals out of a crisis, guiding future interactions. The project and similar work on creating influential language in emails or social media messages involves grafting machine learning with natural language processing and network theory.

While these threads seek to bend the existing logic of machine learning to produce causal insights, Veitch’s other research focus aims to reverse the equation, using causality to change the way machine learning “thinks.” Current systems will often return answers without understanding the context; for example, when you ask a search engine a question, it will return results associated with that text string on different sites, which usually provides an answer but can sometimes produce bizarre or distorted results.

“When we use machine learning methods to solve predictive problems, they often do a great job for really stupid reasons,” Veitch said. “If we think about how humans make decisions, there’s always an implicit causal model at work in our minds. In this area of research, the high level question is how do we use ideas from the mathematical formalism of causal inference to incorporate our human knowledge of the causal structure of the world into the behavior of these predictive systems?”

The result could be machine learning models that don’t exactly think like humans, but that use logical processes that are more familiar to our brains. That could make them more effective partners in tasks such as medicine, hiring, and writing, reduce nonsensical glitches or unethical decisions, and even stave off the science-fiction worst case scenario of a malevolent artificial intelligence.

“The goal is not really to make machine learning models act more like humans, the goal is to make them act in a way that aligns well with your values,” Veitch said. “In the long term, that doesn’t mean human-like decisions at all. But in the short term, I think there are certain aspects from human cognition that we would really like to like to preserve.”

In addition to his research, Veitch will teach courses on causality and machine learning as part of the new data science initiative at UChicago. The university’s vision for data science, with its focus on establishing both the foundations and interdisciplinary applications of the new field, attracted Veitch to campus,

“Many universities are expanding their data science efforts, but UChicago struck me as the most ambitious program,” Veitch said. “The university is treating it as a new field of human endeavor, pulling in insights from all kinds of fields with the goal of identifying the key open problems in this field and defining the area. That level of ambition really appealed to me.”

# What Is Causing Chicago’s Digital Divides? Professors Lead Pilot On South, West Sides To Find Out

Block Club Chicago examines the CDAC initiative developing new data science tools to measure broadband access and working with community partners to bring high-speed internet accessible to all.

As this reporter conducted a Zoom interview from his South Shore home with University of Chicago computer science professor Nick Feamster, the internet connection failed and the call dropped.

Stories like this abound in Chicago’s neglected neighborhoods, where residents struggle to maintain a quality internet connection as they work, study and play from home — or where they lack high-speed internet entirely, Feamster said.

That has motivated Feamster and fellow UChicago professor Nicole Marwell to lead a team of researchers working to turn residents’ anecdotes about their internet issues into “an arsenal of data” to better address the city’s digital divides.

Starting with a pilot phase in South Shore, Englewood, and North Lawndale, the project will use the data to create detailed maps and informational dashboards.

The team will work to determine what solutions are possible for overcoming Chicago’s digital divides — and which are most feasible given the city’s tech infrastructure, political climate and other factors.

* [Recent Projects](#)

  * [Energy](#accordion-tab-0) 

    * [**FracTracker Alliance**](https://www.fractracker.org/) maintains a mobile app that allows registered users to document potentially harmful encroachment of wells, pipelines, trains, refineries, landfills, mines, pits, and compressors within their local communities. The DSI is assisting FracTracker by constructing a backend, cloud-hosted application that routes new complaints to the relevant state and county regulatory agencies through automated email and web form submissions. The DSI has created pipelines for California, Colorado, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. An additional 16 high priority states are in development.
    * **[Physicians for Social Responsibility](https://www.psrpa.org/)** in Pennsylvania initiated a research study to address health risks of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. As part of the fracking process, radioactive material is known to be produced or released into the environment at potentially dangerous levels. In preparation for outreach efforts on their study’s findings, DSI produced a series of data visualizations to help communicate these findings to the public.
  * [Food and Agriculture](#accordion-tab-1) 

    * [**Californians for Pesticide Reform**](https://www.pesticidereform.org/) is a statewide coalition of more than 190 organizations, founded in 1996 to fundamentally shift the way pesticides are used in California. CPR collaborated with DSI and the [Open Spatial Lab](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/open-spatial-lab/) to create an open source, easily-maintainable data tool that enables CPR and partners to query, update, visualize, and utilize California PUR (”Pesticide Use Reporting”) data. The interactive tool allows users to filter or summarize PUR data based on year, active ingredient, product, commodity, and/or agricultural or non-agricultural use; it also produces maps with PUR data aggregated at different spatial scales and charts showing distributions and pesticide usage over time.
    * [**The** **Center for Good Food Purchasing**](https://goodfoodpurchasing.org/) tracks the types of foods that public institutions purchase, rating them on factors including sustainability, worker treatment, and animal welfare. DSI is creating a natural language processing model that will do an automated first pass of the food labeling task. DSI trained multiple different natural language processing (NLP) models to recreate the manual food product name standardization methodology that the Center uses to process invoices and receipts.
    * [**GRAIN**](https://grain.org/#) is a small international non-profit organization that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems. Carbon credit programs are widely criticized for lack of oversight, limited environmental benefit, and negative impacts to local communities’ sovereignty. GRAIN tracks news articles about land deals for carbon farming on farmlandgrab.org. DSI technical staff and [Community Data Fellows](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/community-data-fellows/) have been working to create a tool for relevant news articles and to extract important details. The information is combined with related databases to create a dataset of carbon farming land acquisition deals across the globe.
    * The **[mBio](https://mbioproject.org/)** project is a media analysis pipeline created by DSI to better understand the development of  genetically modified crops (GM crops), particularly across the African continent. African civil society organizations (CSOs) have raised important critiques, noting that biotechnologies pose threats to African sovereignty and the environment. DSI worked with collaborators at University of Cambridge and University of San Francisco to complete an analysis of GM crop development in Africa. The analysis produced a cleaned dataset and visualizations demonstrating the relative success of GM crop development led by different organization types.
    * **[Oakland Institute](https://www.oaklandinstitute.org/)** partners with DSI to track Ukrainian agriculture exports and the consolidation of agricultural land and land reform policy in Ukraine. This collaboration is analyzing the market share of Ukrainian agricultural exports to understand the impact of the UN’s Black Sea Grain Initiative and the large corporations that control large swaths of Ukrainian land. A [Community Data Fellow](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/community-data-fellows/) aggregated and analyzed data on Ukrainian exports from the UN’s Black Sea Grain Initiative, global shipping records, and corporate financial reports to estimate the share of Ukrainian grain exports from large international corporations and oligarchs.
    * [**Perpetual**](https://www.perpetualuse.org/) is a nonprofit organization that aims to reduce plastic waste through city-wide, reusable foodware systems. As part of this system, a foodware flow model will take into account optimal distribution points to ensure that foodware is easily accessible to city dwellers, return is hassle-free, and cleaned with thorough and efficient methods . The DSI is collaborating with Perpetual to implement a data model which will help make the system feasible, sustainable, and convenient for users.
    * [**RAFI-USA**](https://www.rafiusa.org/) (Rural Advancement Foundation International) challenges the root causes of unjust food systems, supporting and advocating for economically, racially, and ecologically just farm communities. RAFI’s initiative Challenging Corporate Power battles corporate consolidation in the food supply chain. DSI and RAFI are collaborating to visualize consolidation in the grocery market with an interactive time series map showing parent company ownership of grocery stores over time.
    * The DSI previously assisted [RAFI](https://www.rafiusa.org/) in building an interactive map dashboard that shows consolidation in the poultry-packing industry. As large corporations gain control of more plants, farmers in such areas are vulnerable to exploitation. DSI students explored multiple crowdsourced and official regulatory datasets to estimate the location and number of farms in areas monopsony-captured by large poultry processing plants. We  built an interactive map and dashboard displaying market consolidation in the poultry-packing industry.
    * [**Hawai’i Alliance for Progressive Action**](https://www.hapahi.org/) (HAPA) and Pesticide Action Network (PAN) are working with the DSI to better understand the use of Restricted Use Pesticides (RUPs)—a dangerous class of pesticide unavailable for public purchase and associated with major health risks like asthma, birth defects, and cancer. The DSI is currently partnering with HAPA and PAN to clean and standardize records, compare listed pesticide application amounts against different regulatory standards and perform a geospatial analysis to determine if certain groups (e.g., school children, Native Hawaiians, low-income households) are more at-risk for pesticide exposure than others.
  * [Human Rights](#accordion-tab-2) 

    * **[Climate Cabinet](https://climatecabinet.org/)** is working with DSI to recreate a map of rural electric cooperatives’ and municipal utilities’ eligibility for clean energy tax credit bonuses under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Since bonuses are higher for investing in low-income, Justice40, and IRA energy communities, referencing these maps will enable public utilities to invest wisely and maximize their tax credit value.
    * [Climate Cabinet](https://climatecabinet.org/) is also working towards public transparency in campaign finance. Climate Cabinet wants to empower candidates for state legislatures to speak to the political influence of the fossil fuel industry vis-à-vis campaign financing relative to the clean energy industry. DSI is locating and downloading historical campaign finance contribution data in order to write scripts to filter the datasets to include only contributions from the fossil fuel and clean energy industries.
    * [**Inclusive Development International**](https://www.inclusivedevelopment.net/) (IDI) has partnered with the DSI to address the palm oil industry, which touches many different consumer products, from lipstick and pizza dough to soap, chocolate, and laundry detergent. Palm oil production has caused massive deforestation, including mills that have caused 47 percent of the deforestation in Indonesia — fueling global climate change and displacing communities in the process. IDI and DSI developed [PalmWatch](https://palmwatch.inclusivedevelopment.net/), a public, interactive data tool that links deforestation to mills, mill parent companies, and the consumer brands that source from them.
    * **[WoMin African Alliance](https://womin.africa/)** partnered with DSI on a development project dashboard. For the past year, WoMin has been collecting data to track projects within its service area and link its programming (workshops, fairs, etc.) to those affected areas.  DSI is collaborating with WoMin to build a dashboard that will allow its staff members and partners to more effectively target communities in need of supportive services, and trace the legal and financial relationships among the banks, governments, and firms affiliated with development projects to identify “pressure points” most responsive to advocacy.
    * [**BankTrack**](https://www.banktrack.org/) is working with Inclusive Development International (IDI) and DSI to build a commercial loan disclosure pipeline. Each year, banks finance projects and companies around the world by providing billions of dollars of loans. This information is not easily available for individual cases and is even more difficult to view at a macro level. The end goal of this project is to create a publicly available database of corporate debt of publicly traded companies in order to track where and how they acquire financial capital.
    * **[DeBIT](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/insights/debit-development-bank-investment-tracker/)** is a development bank investment tracker, created by DSI in collaboration with the IDI and Accountability Counsel. This tool regularly scrapes multilateral development bank sites for development project data and then cleans, aggregates, and merges that data with complaints provided by Accountability Counsel. Community advocates and researchers can then query and export that data through a public web interface. Since its launch in May 2022, IDI has used DeBIT to conduct training workshops with local advocacy groups.
  * [Marine Technology](#accordion-tab-3) 

    * [**Blue Ocean Gear**](https://www.blueoceangear.com/) is dedicated to preventing lost fishing gear and the subsequent negative impacts of ghost fishing while also improving operational efficiency for fishers through better data tracking. Blue Ocean Gear wanted to leverage available datasets on ocean conditions to better predict fishing gear drift when it breaks free in strong ocean conditions and to better understand their buoy sensors relative to baseline measurements. Students trained two deep learning models on both real and synthetic drifter data to predict the trajectory of drifting smart buoys. The students also built pipelines to harvest wind and global drifter data and then made a first pass at training and testing a model on that data.
    * The [**Center for Biological Diversity**](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/) is a nonprofit membership organization working on the issue of ocean acidification. Every two years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires states to solicit for data to help them identify impaired water bodies. The Center for Biological Diversity helps to ensure that states have the best available data during their reviews. This collaboration aims automated the sharing of data about ocean acidification on the West Coast for states to use as they prepare their Clean Water Act 303d lists of impaired water bodies.
    * [**GreenWave**](https://www.greenwave.org/) supports kelp farmers through their Kelp Climate Fund, which promotes the environmental benefits of macroalgae by paying farmers for the positive externalities created by kelp farms based on how much kelp they grow. GreenWave previously had farmers send in photographs of their kelp growths, but photos can vary widely in their angle, background, and resolution. This led to the need for a model that can predict the mass of kelp from a photograph. DSI students found the most promising method was a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained to segment images into kelp and non-kelp sections. DSI staff cleaned the training dataset, refactored it and improved code quality. With this tool GreenWave will be able more quickly and accurately disperse funding to farmers.
    * [**Remora**](https://www.remoraxyz.com/) is a Costa Rican startup focused on sustainable fishing. There are many small-scale fishing boats and remote landing centers in Costa Rica, making tracking the health of fisheries challenging. Remora’s solution is a product called the Smart Scale — a device that uses computer vision to estimate the species, weight, and length of a fish from an image captured at the landing center. DSI built and trained a multi-task computer vision model that is able to classify the species and estimate the weight and length of fish from a single image — all while running on the computationally-constrained Smart Scale hardware.

Community Data Fellows

# Program Details

The Community Data Fellows program was launched as a pilot program in Fall 2022 and expanded in Spring 2023 through grant funding by the [Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN)](https://www.newamerica.org/pit/), a partnership of universities dedicated to combining public policy and digital innovation for societal benefit. This program is anchored by the Data Science Institute’s core principle of community-centered data science. The Community Data Fellows program pairs community-based nonprofit and government organizations with UChicago graduate students. Students work as data consultants, working with the organizations to identify their data science needs and goals and developing project plans and deliverables to help the organizations improve their outreach and impact. Building mutually-beneficial community partnerships is key to this program.

#### **PARTNERS**

Community organizations supporting marginalized or underserved global or local communities are welcome to partner with the Community Data Fellows program. There is no cost for organizations to participate. Partners aren’t expected to be data experts– staff and students will work closely with partners to determine the organization’s data capacity and recommend custom projects or open-source solutions that address specific data needs within the organization.

#### **STUDENTS**

UChicago graduate students can apply for a paid Fellowship and participate in a variety of social impact data projects. Some projects are more intensive with short-term deliverables, and others extend over multiple quarters. Students can expect to collaborate with global and local community organizations to assess data needs and create real-world, applicable solutions. Supported by the technical and administrative staff, Fellows will gain leadership and consulting skills, hone their data science skills through practical labs, and contribute directly to positive community impact.

**Talk Title:** Modeling the Impact of Social Determinants of Health on Covid-19 Transmission and Mortality to Understand Health Inequities

[Watch Abby’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLQ1kX6UYY8&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=9)

**Talk Abstract:** The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted drastic health inequities, particularly in cities such as Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, and New York City. Reducing Covid-19 morbidity and mortality will likely require an increased focus on social determinants of health, given their disproportionate impact on populations most heavily affected by Covid-19. A better understanding of how factors such as household income, housing location, health care access, and incarceration contribute to Covid-19 transmission and mortality is needed to inform policies around social distancing and testing and vaccination scale-up.

This work builds upon an existing agent-based model of Covid-19 transmission in Chicago, CityCOVID. CityCOVID consists of a synthetic population that is statistically representative of Chicago’s population (2.7 million persons), along with their associated places (1.4 million places) and behaviors (13,000 activity schedules). During a simulated day, agents move from place-to-place, hour-by-hour, engaging in social activities and interactions with other colocated agents, resulting in an endogenous colocation or contact network. Covid-19 transmission is determined via a simulated epidemiological model based on this generated contact network by tuning (fitting) model parameters that result in simulation output that matches observed Covid-19 death and hospitalization data from the City of Chicago. Using the CityCOVID infrastructure, we quantify the impact of social determinants of health on Covid-19 transmission dynamics by applying statistical techniques to empirical data to study the relationship between social determinants of health and Covid-19 outcomes.

**Bio:** Abby Stevens is fourth year statistics PhD student at the University of Chicago advised by Rebecca Willett. She is interested in using data science techniques to address important social and political issues, such as climate science, public health, and algorithmic fairness. She graduated with a math degree from Grinnell College in 2014 and then worked as a data scientist at a healthcare tech company before entering graduate school. She has been involved in a number of data science for social good organizations and is a primary organizer of the Women in Data Science Chicago annual event.

# Adam Fouda

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Complex autoionization processes following x-ray-matter interactions involve the ejection of electrons via the decay of unstable states created by the x-rays. This fundamental process affects the determination of structure and its temporal evolution across the biological and physical sciences. Three examples include:

* Metal atoms, acting as crucial reactive centres in proteins, are highly susceptible to radiation damage by x-rays. The resulting electronic rearrangements on ultrafast timescales is the limiting factor to structural resolution in metalloprotein x-ray crystallography.
* Autoionization is the dominant decay pathway following x-ray absorption in light elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. The high detection yields of the ejected electrons provides a powerful observable for sophisticated experiments using attosecond x-ray pulses to study real time charge transfer dynamics.
* Radionucleotide decay creates the unstable states which undergo analogous autoionization processes to those induced by X-rays. Novel highly-targeted cancer therapies are exploiting the ejected electrons’ short travel distances in aqueous environments, to selectively damage tumour cell-membranes whilst minimizing damage to surrounding the environment.

Thus far, the complex nature of x-ray induced autoionization limits quantum molecular simulations to isolated molecules and simple condensed phase systems. The goal of Fouda’s research is the development of AI applications accelerating both the predictive and analytical strength available for x-ray induced autoionization simulation.

**BIO**:

Adam Fouda is a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow based in the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago. Before moving to Chicago, Fouda completed Chemistry MSci and Computational Chemistry PhD degrees at The University of Nottingham (UK). This led a postdoctoral position in the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics Group at Argonne National Laboratory. Fouda’s broad research interests include the development of computational methods for predicting and interpreting molecular x-ray spectroscopy experiments.

# Aditi Krishnapriyan

Currently: Assistant Professor, UC Berkeley; Previously: Alvarez Fellow, University of California, Berkeley & Lawrence Berkeley National Lab

**Bio:**Aditi Krishnapriyan is the 2020 Alvarez Fellow in Computing Sciences at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and UC Berkeley. Previously, she received a PhD at Stanford University, supported by the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship. During her PhD, she also spent time working on machine learning research at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Toyota Research Institute, and Google Research. Her research interests include combining domain-driven scientific mechanistic modeling with data-driven machine learning methodologies to accelerate and improve spatial and temporal modeling.

**Talk Title:**Integrating Machine Learning with Physics-Based Spatial and Temporal Modeling

**Talk Abstract:**Deep learning has achieved great success in numerous areas, and is also seeing increasing interest in scientific applications. However, challenges still remain: scientific phenomena are difficult to model, and can also be limited by a lack of training data. As a result, scientific machine learning approaches are being developed by incorporating domain knowledge into the machine learning process to enable more accurate and general predictions. One such popular approach, colloquially known as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), incorporates domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss function. I will discuss the challenges associated with such an approach, and show that by changing the learning paradigm to curriculum regularization or sequence-to-sequence learning, we can achieve significantly lower error. Another approach, colloquially known as ODE-Nets, aims to couple dynamical systems/numerical methods with neural networks. I will discuss how exploiting techniques from numerical analysis for these systems can enable learning continuous, function-to-function mappings for scientific problems.

# Aditya Nandy

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Aditya Nandy is working on a shape-changing membrane protein present in the inner ear, uniquely called prestin due to its fast kinetics. This protein governs the movement of the outer hair cell of the inner ear, enabling mammals to hear across wide frequency ranges. He is investigating how multiple prestin molecules are coupled to each other in the outer hair cell, leading to emergent phenomena that cannot be explained by a single prestin molecule. At the University of Chicago, Aditya is interested in learning more about the applications of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and AI/ML to biophysical systems. He is modeling the outer hair cell (and prestin) from both atomistic and continuum perspectives.

**BIO**:

Aditya Nandy joined the University of Chicago in 2023 as an Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow, working jointly between Profs. Benoit Roux, Eduardo Perozo, and Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan. He received his Ph.D. in Theoretical Chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under the supervision of Prof. Heather J. Kulik, where he was a NSF Graduate Research Fellow. During his Ph.D., Aditya used data-driven methods to explore large design spaces of transition metal complexes and metal-organic frameworks that could be useful for catalysis or gas separations applications. Prior to MIT, Aditya received his B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was an experimental NMR spectroscopist under the tutelage of Prof. Jeffrey A. Reimer. In 2025, Aditya will start his independent career at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department.

**Talk Title:** Covariant Neural Networks for Physics Applications

[Watch Alexander’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTWfe_vuSc&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=2)

**Talk Abstract:** Most traditional neural network architectures do not respect any intrinsic structure of the input data, and instead are expect to “learn” it. CNNs are the first widespread example of a symmetry, in this case the translational symmetry of images, being used to advise much more efficient and transparent network architectures. More recently, CNNs were generalized to other non-commutative symmetry groups such as SO(3). However, in physics application one is more likely to encounter input data that belong to linear representations of Lie Groups, as opposed to being functions (or “images”) on a symmetric space of the group.

To deal with such problems, I will present a general feed-forward architecture that takes vectors as inputs, works entirely in the Fourier space of the symmetry group, and is fully covariant. This approach allows one to achieve equal performance with drastically fewer learnable parameters, Moreover, the models become much more physically meaningful and more likely to be interpretable. My application of choice is in particle physics, where the main symmetry is the 6-dimensional Lorentz group. I will demonstrate the success of covariant architectures compared to more conventional approaches.

**Bio:** I am a PhD student at the University of Chicago working on theoretical hydrodynamics problems in relation to the quantum Hall effect. In addition, I am working on developing new group-covariant machine learning tools for physics applications, such as Lorentz-covariant neural networks for particle physics. My background is in mathematical physics, in which I hold a master’s degree from the Saint-Petersburg University in Russia. My interests lie on the intersection of theoretical and mathematical physics and new inter-disciplinary applications of such ideas.

His work has been published in AAAI, KDD, NeurIPS, and BigData, and awarded the 1st place in the Facebook/CMU COVID-19 Challenge and the 2nd place in the C3.ai COVID-19 Grand Challenge. He also has served as workshop organizer in BPDM @ KDD 2017 and epiDAMIK @ KDD 2021.

**Talk Title:**Deep Learning Frameworks for Epidemic Forecasting

**Talk Abstract:**Our vulnerability to emerging infectious diseases has been illustrated with the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Forecasting epidemic trajectories (such as future incidence over the next four weeks) gives policymakers a valuable input for designing effective healthcare policies and optimizing supply chain decisions. However, this is a non-trivial task with multiple open questions. In this talk, I will present our neural frameworks for epidemic forecasting, using seasonal influenza and the COVID-19 as examples. I will introduce our efforts in three research directions: (1) awareness of multiple facets of the epidemic dynamics, (2) coping with challenges from using public health data, and (3) readiness to provide actionable forecasts and insights. I will first discuss our deployed model for predicting COVID-associated indicators, which has been recognized as a top short-term forecasting model among all models submitting predictions to the CDC. I will also introduce how to use deep learning to adapt a historical flu model to an emerging scenario where COVID and flu coexist by leveraging auxiliary data sources. Next, I will introduce deep learning frameworks for incorporating expert-guidance, principled uncertainty quantification for well-calibrated forecasts, and handling data revisions for refining forecasts. Finally, I will share some future research directions.

**Talk Title:** Validity, equity, and oversight in societally consequential machine learning

**Talk Abstract:** Machine learning algorithms are widely used for decision-making in societally high-stakes settings from child welfare and criminal justice to healthcare and consumer lending. Recent history has illuminated numerous examples where these algorithms proved unreliable or inequitable. We take a principled approach to the use of machine learning in societally high-stakes settings, guided by three pillars: validity, equity, and oversight. We address data problems that challenge the validity of algorithmic decision support systems by developing methods for algorithmic risk assessments that account for selection bias, confounding, and bandit feedback. We conduct audits for bias throughout the systems in which algorithms are used to inform decision-making. Throughout we propose novel methods that use doubly-robust techniques for bias correction. We apply our methods to the consumer lending context where we find that use of our methods could extend lending opportunities to applicants from historically underbanked regions without an increase in the average rate of default. We present additional findings in the child welfare, criminal justice and healthcare settings.

**Bio:**Amanda Kube is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Division of Computational and Data Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis working with Dr. Sanmay Das in the Department of Computer Science and Dr. Patrick Fowler in the Brown School. She received her B.S. in Psychological and Brain Sciences and Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics from Washington University in St. Louis where she also received an M.S. in Data Analytics and Statistics. Her research interests involve the intersection of computation and the social sciences. Her current work combines machine learning and human decision-making to inform fair and efficient service allocations for homeless families.

**Talk Title:**Integrating Human Priorities and Data-Driven Improvements in Allocation of Scarce Homeless Services to Households in Need

**Talk Abstract:**Homelessness is a major public health issue in the United States that has gained visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite efforts at the federal level, rates of homelessness are not decreasing. Homeless services are a scarce public resource and current allocation systems have not been thoroughly investigated. Algorithmic techniques excel at modeling complex interactions between features and therefore have potential to model effects of homeless services at the individual level. These models can reason counterfactually about the effects of different services on each household and resulting predictions can be used for matching households to services. The ability to model heterogeneity in treatment effects of services provides the potential for “precision public health” where allocation of services is based on data-driven predictions of which service will lead to better outcomes. I discuss the scarce resource allocation problem as it applies to homeless service delivery, and the ability to improve upon the current allocation system using algorithmic techniques. I compare prediction algorithms to each other as well as to the ability of the general public to make these decisions. As homeless services are scarce public goods, it is vital to ensure allocations are not only efficient, but fair and ethical. I discuss efforts to ensure fair decisions and to understand how people prioritize households who should receive scarce homeless services. I also discuss future work and next steps as well as policy implications.

**Talk Title:**Crypt$\epsilon$: Crypto-Assisted Differential Privacy on Untrusted Servers

**Talk Abstract:**Differential privacy (DP) is currently the de-facto standard for achieving privacy in data analysis, which is typically implemented either in the ”central” or ”local” model. The local model has been more popular for commercial deployments as it does not require a trusted data collector. This increased privacy, however, comes at the cost of utility and algorithmic expressibility as compared to the central model.

In this talk, I will be presenting Crypt$\epsilon$, a system and programming framework that (1) achieves the accuracy guarantees and algorithmic expressibility of the central model (2) without any trusted data collector like in the local model. Crypt$\epsilon$ achieves the ”best of both worlds” by employing two non-colluding untrusted servers that run DP programs on encrypted data from the data owners. In theory, straightforward implementations of DP programs using off-the-shelf secure multi-party computation tools can achieve the above goal. However, in practice, they are beset with many challenges like poor performance and tricky security proofs. To this end, Crypt$\epsilon$ allows data analysts to author logical DP programs that are automatically translated to secure protocols that work on encrypted data. These protocols ensure that the untrusted servers learn nothing more than the noisy outputs, thereby guaranteeing DP for all Crypt$\epsilon$ programs. Crypt$\epsilon$ supports a rich class of DP programs that can be expressed via a small set of transformation and measurement operators followed by arbitrary post-processing. Further, I will talk about a novel performance optimization that leverages the fact that the output is noisy. Consequently, Crypt$\epsilon$ achieves performance that is practical for real-world usage.

# Andrew Ferguson

Associate Professor of Molecular Engineering

I lead an interdisciplinary computational and theoretical research group working on materials self-assembly, biomolecular simulation, viral dynamics, and vaccine design. My doctoral training provided me with expertise in molecular simulation, statistical mechanics, and machine learning, in which I developed new nonlinear machine learning approaches to study the conformations and dynamics of proteins, polymers, and confined water. During my post-doctoral fellowship, I acquired knowledge and skills in immunology and viral dynamics, and developed new computational tools for structure-free prediction of antibody binding sites, and the computational design of HIV vaccines using statistical mechanical principles.

Since establishing my independent research program in 2012, I have combined these expertise to establish a dynamic research program in computational materials science and computational virology for which I have attracted over $2.9M in federal research funding, established a strong publication record (60+ papers) in leading journals, and have been recognized with a number of national awards including a 2018 Royal Society of Chemistry Molecular Systems Design and Engineering Emerging Investigator Award, 2017 Dean’s Award for Excellence in Research, 2016 AIChE CoMSEF Young Investigator Award, 2015 ACS Outstanding Junior Faculty Award, 2014 ACS Petroleum Research Fund Doctoral New Investigator Award, 2013 NSF CAREER Award, and I was named the 2013 Institution of Chemical Engineers North America “Young Chemical Engineer of the Year”. I am engaged and active within my professional organization serving on the AIChE Area 1a Programming Committee and as CoMSEF Liaison Director, and in organizing multiple scientific sessions at our national meetings. In addition to independent theoretical work, my research interests lead naturally to close collaboration with experimentalists and clinicians, teaching me the power of mutually reinforcing theoretical and experimental work and the importance of effective communication, planning, budgeting, teamwork and leadership.

**Talk Title:** Credible and Effective Data-Driven Decision-Making: Minimax Policy Learning under Unobserved Confounding

**Talk Abstract:** We study the problem of learning causal-effect maximizing personalized decision policies from observational data while accounting for possible unobserved confounding. Since policy value and regret may not be point-identifiable, we study a method that minimizes the worst-case estimated regret over an uncertainty set for propensity weights that controls the extent of unobserved confounding. We prove generalization guarantees that ensure our policy will be safe when applied in practice and will in fact obtain the best-possible uniform control on the range of all possible population regrets that agree with the possible extent of confounding. Finally, we assess and compare our methods on synthetic and semi-synthetic data. In particular, we consider a case study on personalizing hormone replacement therapy based on the parallel WHI observational study and clinical trial. We demonstrate that hidden confounding can hinder existing policy learning approaches and lead to unwarranted harm, while our robust approach guarantees safety and focuses on well-evidenced improvement.  This work is joint with Nathan Kallus. An earlier version was circulated as “Confounding-Robust Policy Improvement”.  Time permitting, I will highlight recent follow-up work on robust policy evaluation for infinite-horizon reinforcement learning. 

**Bio:** My research interests are at the intersection of statistical machine learning and operations research in order to inform reliable data-driven decision-making. Specifically, I have developed fundamental contributions and algorithmic frameworks for robust causal-effect-maximizing personalized decision rules in view of unobserved confounding, as well as methodology for credible impact evaluation for algorithmic fairness with high potential impact in industry and policy. My work has been published in journals such as Management Science and top-tier computer science/machine learning venues (Neurips/ICML), and has received a INFORMS Data Mining Section Best Paper award. My work was previously supported on a NDSEG (National Defense Science and Engineering) Graduate Fellowship.

**Talk Title:**Building Language Technologies for Analyzing Online Activism

**Talk Abstract:**While recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have greatly enhanced our ability to analyze online text, distilling broad social-oriented research questions into tasks concrete enough for NLP models remains challenging. In this work, we develop state-of-the-art NLP models grounded in frameworks from social psychology in order to analyze two social media movements: online media coverage of the #MeToo movement in 2017-2018 and tweets about #BlackLivesMatter protests in 2020. In the first part, we show that despite common perception of the #MeToo movement as empowering, media coverage of events often portrayed women as sympathetic but unpowerful. In the second, we show that positive emotions like hope and optimism are prevalent in tweets with pro-BlackLivesMatter hashtags and significantly correlated with the presence of on-the-ground protests, whereas anger and disgust are not. These results contrast stereotypical portrayals of protesters as perpetuating anger and outrage. Overall, our work provides insight into social movements and debunks harmful stereotypes. We aim to bridge the gap between NLP, where models are often not designed to address social-oriented questions, and computational social science, where state-of-the-art NLP has often been underutilized.

**Talk Title:**Deep Interpretable Generative Learning for Science and Engineering

**Abstract:**Discriminative and generative AI represent two deep learning paradigms that have sparked a revolution in predicting and generating high-quality realistic images from text prompts. Nonetheless, discriminative learning lacks the capacity to generate data, while deep generative models face challenges in decoding capabilities. A key challenge, which could brought the next breakthrough in AI, lies in the unification of these two paradigms. Moreover, both deep learning approaches are data-hungry and thus does not perform well in data-scarce applications. Furthermore, deep learning suffers from low interpretability; no comprehensive framework exists to describe construction of non-trivial representations and predictions by discriminative models. These drawbacks have posed significant barriers to the adoption of deep learning in applications where a) acquiring supervised data is expensive or infeasible, and b) goals extend beyond data fitting to attain scientific insights. Specifically, deep learning applications are fairly unexplored in fields with rich mathematical and optimization frameworks such as inverse problems, or those in which interpretability matters. This talk discusses the theory and applications of deep learning in data-limited or unsupervised inverse problems. These include applications in radar sensing, Poisson image denoising, and computational neuroscience.

**Talk Title:**Decoding Real-World Evidence: Bridging GAMs and LLMs to Expose “Death by Round Numbers”

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing natural language processing, but combining their implicit knowledge with explicit statistical machine learning models is an ongoing challenge. To bridge these systems, we propose to use generalized additive models (GAMs). GAMs decompose complex outcomes into separable component functions, creating a modular structure that fits seamlessly into LLM context windows. As a result, GAMs can unleash the power of LLMs for traditional machine learning tasks.

We demonstrate an exciting application of this perspective: automated surprise finding. Real-world data science grapples with complications like hidden confounding, often necessitating manual model inspections by domain experts. For instance, treatment-based confounding in medical data may inadvertently teach data- driven systems to perpetuate inherent biases. However, by bridging GAMs with LLMs, we harness the vast knowledge reservoir within LLMs to auto-detect anomalies that appear to contradict domain expertise.

This approach not only improves machine learning models, but also reveals quirks of the underlying system. Using this combination of glass-box GAMs and foundational LLMs, we evaluate four datasets of real-world medical evidence, identifying two characteristic types of medical biases: (1) discontinuous risk at sharp treatment thresholds and (2) counter-causal paradoxes where aggressive treatment reduces perceived risk.

Finally, we present the TalkToEBM package to establish this bridge between GAMs and LLMs and offer a lens to automatically identify surprising effects in statistical models.

# Bridget Fahey

Assistant Professor, Law; Faculty Co-Director, Data Ecology

Bridget Fahey is an Assistant Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School. Her research in constitutional law focuses on the theory and practice of American federalism, especially how our domestic governments interact in unexpected ways and use unorthodox legal tools to structure their joint projects. Her forthcoming co-authored article *Layered Constitutionalism and Structural Interdependency*, 124 Colum. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2024), identifies and theorizes a largely hidden body of federal constitutional rules that shape—in ways expected and unexpected—state structural choices.

Her earlier article *Coordinated Rulemaking and Cooperative Federalism’s Administrative State*, [132 Yale L.J. 1213](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4226284) (2023), argues that cooperative federalism programs have given rise to a distinctive administrative state—with forms of administrative action and legal frameworks that diverge in important respects from ordinary federal and state administrative law. The Article illustrates this point by identifying a distinctive form of legislative rulemaking—“coordinated rulemaking”—which is widely used in cooperative federalism programs, but cannot be assimilated into familiar administrative law frameworks. Her article *Data Federalism*, [135 Harv. L. Rev. 1107](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4172184) (2022), uncovers a vast intergovernmental market in private data exchanged by federal, state, and local governments, and the unusual cross-governmental bureaucracies that govern that market. Both pieces expound on the insight she first developed in *Federalism by Contract*, [129 Yale L.J. 2326](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3640469) (2020), which demonstrated that the federal government and states use contract-like instruments to structure intergovernmental programs and transact in a wide range of governmental powers. Before joining the faculty, her article *Consent Procedures and American Federalism*, [128 Harv. L. Rev. 1561](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2490605) (2015), identified and theorized the federal government’s practice of using cooperative federalism programs to intervene in and reshape state and local governing processes.

Professor Fahey is also interested in the government stewardship of private data. Building on *Data Federalism*, her cross-disciplinary [work](https://neubauercollegium.uchicago.edu/research/government-data-markets-mapping-and-evaluating-problems-in-intergovernmental-data-flows) funded by a grant from the Neubauer Collegium aims to develop a descriptive and conceptual understanding of the legal-technical architectures that shape of how data moves between—and is controlled by—our domestic governments.

Professor Fahey received a BA in Political Science from the University of Chicago and a JD from Yale Law School. Before joining the faculty, she was a litigator at the Washington DC office of WilmerHale, held a fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and was a law clerk on the DC Circuit and on the Supreme Court of the United States for Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Earlier in her career, Professor Fahey worked as a management consultant for the Boston Consulting Group in Chicago and Berlin.

She teaches 1L Contracts and Constitutional Law, co-coordinates the Public Law Workshop, and has taught informal Greenberg Seminars on eclectic topics including Space Law, Order Without Law, Free Speech on Campus, and others.

# Bryan Wilder

Currently: Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University; Previously: Schmidt Science Fellow, Harvard School of Public Health and Carnegie Mellon University and PhD Candidate, Computer Science, Harvard University

**Talk Title:** AI for Population Health: Melding Data and Algorithms on Networks

[Watch Bryan’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffiAO_ufWB8&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=12)

**Talk Abstract:** As exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, our health and wellbeing depend on a difficult-to-measure web of societal factors and individual behaviors. Tackling social challenges with AI requires algorithmic and data-driven paradigms which span the full process of gathering costly data, learning models to understand and predict interactions, and optimizing the use of limited resources in interventions. This talk presents methodological developments at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and social networks which are motivated by on-the-ground collaborations on HIV prevention, tuberculosis treatment, and the COVID-19 response. These projects have produced deployed applications and policy impact. For example, I will present the development of an AI-augmented intervention for HIV prevention among homeless youth. This system was evaluated in a field test enrolling over 700 youth and found to significantly reduce key risk behaviors for HIV.

**Bio:** Bryan Wilder is a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University, where he is advised by Milind Tambe. His research focuses on the intersection of optimization, machine learning, and social networks, motivated by applications to population health. His work has received or been nominated for best paper awards at ICML and AAMAS, and was a finalist for the INFORMS Doing Good with Good OR competition. He is supported by the Siebel Scholars program and previously received a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

# Cecilia Testart

Currently: Assistant Professor, Georgia Tech; Previously: Postdoctoral Associate, CSAIL, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and PhD Candidate, EECS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

**Talk Title:**Towards Data-Driven Internet Routing Security

**Talk Abstract:** The Internet ecosystem is critical for the reliability of online daily life. However, key Internet protocols, such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), were not designed to cope with untrustworthy parties, making them vulnerable to misconfigurations and attacks from anywhere in the network. In this talk, I will present an evidence-based data-driven approach to improve routing infrastructure security, which I use to identify and characterize BGP serial hijackers, networks that persistently hijack IP address blocks in BGP. I’ll also show how similar approaches can quantify the benefits of the RPKI security framework against prefix hijacks, and identify route leaks. This work improves our understanding about how our Internet actually works and has been used by industry and researchers for network reputation and monitoring of operational security practices.

**Bio:**Cecilia Testart is a PhD candidate in EECS at MIT, working with David D. Clark. Her research is at the intersection of computer networks, data science and policy. Her doctoral thesis focuses on securing the Internet’s core routing protocols, leveraging machine learning and data science approaches to understand the impact of protocol design in security, and considering both technical and policy challenges to improve the current state-of-the-art. Cecilia holds Engineering Degrees from Universidad de Chile and Ecole Centrale Paris and a dual-master degree in Technology and Policy and EECS from MIT. Prior to joining MIT, she helped set up the Chilean office of Inria (the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology) and worked for the research lab of the .CL, the Chilean top-level domain. She has interned at Akamai, MSR and the OECD. Cecilia’s work was awarded with a Distinguished paper award at the ACM Internet Measurement Conference in 2019.

**Talk Title:** Challenges in Opinion Manipulation Detection: An Examination of Wartime Russian Media

**Talk Abstract:** Information warfare has been at the forefront of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war, as all sides attempt to shape online narratives. NLP could be valuable for combating manipulation, but most prior work focuses on detecting extreme manipulation strategies like fake news and relies on supervised approaches with pre-annotated data, which is unavailable in emerging crises. We release a new dataset, VoynaSlov, containing 38M+ social media posts from Russian media and their public responses. We characterize VoynaSlov along three dimensions: media ownership (state-affiliated, independent), platform (Twitter, VKontakte), and time (pre-war, during-war). Drawing from political communication, we investigate subtle manipulation strategies by applying state-of-the-art NLP models to quantify agenda-setting, framing, and priming. Our methodology includes word frequencies, topic modeling, supervised classification, and consideration of metadata such as likes or shares. Each technique reveals interesting, yet sometimes conflicting, insights; for example, independent outlets are more likely to use war-related words, but state-affiliated outlets discuss war-related topics more. Throughout the talk, we discuss numerous limitations: topic model interpretability and instability, unclear framing typologies and domain-specificity, and issues surrounding validity and misuse for priming. Our dataset, initial investigation, and discussion of open technical challenges can facilitate the identification and mitigation of information manipulation tactics in ongoing crisis situations.

# Chao Ma

Szego Assistant Professor, Stanford University

**Bio:** Chao Ma is a Szego Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Stanford University. His research focuses on building mathematical theories for modern machine learning methods. His recent works provided understandings to the implicit regularization effect of various optimization algorithms for neural networks, by studying the interaction between the algorithms and the network structures. Before joining Stanford, Chao obtained his PhD from the Program of Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University, advised by Prof. Weinan E. His thesis mathematically analyzed the approximation and generalization capacity of neural networks.

**Talk Title:** Implicit bias of optimization algorithms for neural networks and their effects on generalization

**Talk Abstract:** Modern neural networks are usually over-parameterized—the number of parameters exceeds the number of training data. In this case the loss functions tend to have many (or even infinite) global minima, which imposes an additional challenge of minima selection on optimization algorithms besides the convergence. Specifically, when training a neural network, the algorithm not only has to find a global minimum, but also needs to select minima with good generalization among many other bad ones. In this talk, I will share a series of works studying the mechanisms that facilitate global minima selection of optimization algorithms. First, with a linear stability theory, we show that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) favors flat and uniform global minima. Then, we build a theoretical connection of flatness and generalization performance based on a common structure of neural networks. Next, we study the global minima selection dynamics—the process that an optimizer leaves bad minima for good ones—in two settings. For a manifold of minima around which the loss function grows quadratically, we derive effective exploration dynamics on the manifold for SGD and Adam, using a quasistatic approach. For a manifold of minima around which the loss function grows subquadratically, we study the behavior and effective dynamics for GD, which also explains the edge of stability phenomenon.

# Chris Kennedy

William H. Colvin Professor and Chair, Department of Linguistics and Humanities Collegiate Division

My work is geared towards discovering and describing the principles that are involved in relating linguistic forms to meanings; determining how this mapping is achieved through the interaction of properties of the linguistic system, properties of cognition more generally, and broader features of communicative contexts; and understanding the extent to which structural and typological features of language can be explained in terms of meaning.  Over the past two decades, I have explored these issues primarily through a focused exploration of the language of comparison, amount and degree, though my research has also touched on core issues in the syntax-semantics interface such as ellipsis, anaphora, and quantification.

# Colm Talbot

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Colm Talbot works on applications of computational Bayesian inference in gravitational-wave astronomy. Collisions of black holes and neutron stars in the distant universe emit more energy in their final moments than all of the stars in the Universe. This energy is carried away as gravitational radiation, stretching and squeezing spacetime as they travel. After the first observation by advanced LIGO in 2015, these waves are now routinely observed. Talbot is interested in developing statistical methods, computational techniques, and theoretical models that enable us to use these observations to learn about the astrophysics of massive stars and the nature of relativity. In the coming years, the field of gravitational-wave astronomy will enter a data-rich era allowing for high-precision tests of astrophysics and fundamental physics. However, leveraging this larger dataset will require novel analysis techniques where AI methods show great promise. Additionally, Talbot is committed to developing open-source software tools for astrophysics.

**BIO**:

Colm Talbot joined the University of Chicago in 2023 as a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow, working at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics. Talbot received a B.A. in astrophysics and M. Math in applied mathematics and theoretical physics from the University of Cambridge in 2016 and a PhD in astronomy from Monash University advised by Eric Thrane in 2020. After this, Talbot spent 18 months as a postdoctoral researcher in the LIGO Laboratory, Caltech and two years as a Kavli Postdoctoral Fellow at MIT.

# David Miller

Associate Professor, Dept. of Physics, Enrico Fermi Institute, and the College; Faculty Co-Director, AI + Science

David Miller’s research focuses on answering open questions about the fundamental structure of matter. By studying the quarks and gluons -—the particles that comprise everyday protons and neutrons —produced in the energetic collisions of protons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, Miller conducts measurements using the ATLAS Detector that will seek out the existence of never-before-seen particles, and characterize the particles and forces that we know of with greater precision. Miller’s work into the properties and measurements of the experimental signatures of these quarks and gluons –or jets” –is an integral piece of the puzzle used in the recent discovery of the Higgs bosons, searches for new massive particles that decay into boosted top quarks, as well as the hints that the elusive quark-gluon-plasma may have finally been observed in collisions of lead ions.

Besides studying these phenomena, Miller has worked extensively on the construction and operation of the ATLAS detector, including the calorimeter and tracking systems that allow for these detailed measurements. Upgrades to these systems involving colleagues at Argonne National Laboratory, CERN, and elsewhere present an enormous challenge and a significant amount of research over the next several years. Miller is also working with state-of-the art high-speed electronics for quickly deciphering the data collected by the ATLAS detector.

Miller received his PhD from Stanford University in 2011 and his BA in Physics from the University of Chicago in 2005. He was a McCormick Fellow in the Enrico Fermi Institute from 2011-2013.

**Talk Title:**Machine Learning for Astrophysics & Cosmology in the Era of Large Astronomical Surveys and an Application for the Discovery and Classification of Faint Galaxies

[Watch Dimitrios’ Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA2zFsspsJ4&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=10)

**Talk Abstract:** Observational astrophysics & cosmology are entering the era of big-data. Future astronomical surveys are expected to collect hundreds of petabytes of data and detect billions of objects. Machine learning will play an important role in the analysis of these surveys with the potential to revolutionize astronomy, as well as providing challenging problems that can give opportunities for breakthroughs in the fundamental understanding of machine learning  
In this talk I will present the discovery of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. LBGSs are galaxies with intrinsic brightness less than that of the dark sky, and so are hard to detect and study. At the same time, they are expected to dominate the number density of galaxies in the universe, which thus remains relatively unexplored. I will discuss the development of automated, deep learning-based, pipelines for LSBG detection (separation of LSB galaxies from LSB artifacts present in images) and morphological classification. Such techniques will be extremely valuable in the advent of very large future surveys like the planned Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

**Bio:**Dimitrios Tanoglidis is a fifth-year PhD student at the department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. He holds a BSc in Physics and MSc in Theoretical Physics, both from the University of Crete, Greece. His research interests lie in cosmology, analysis of large galaxy surveys, and data science applications in astrophysics. He has led the research for the discovery and analysis of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey Data using machine learning. Interdisciplinary in nature, he is also pursuing a certificate in Computational Social Science.

**Talk Title:** Network Effects on Outcomes and Unequal Distribution of Resources

[Watch Eaman’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxs5qN0JObg&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=5)

**Talk Abstract:**We study how networks affect different groups differently and provide pathways to reinforce existing inequalities. First we provide observational evidence for differential network advantages in access to information: individuals from the low status group receive lower marginal benefit from networking than the high status group. Second, we provide causal evidence for differential diffusion of a new behavior in the network, mainly driven due to homophily and slight initial advantages of a group. Third, we develop a theoretical network model that captures the network structure of unequal access to opportunities. We show that any departure from the uniform distribution of links to information sources among members of a group limits the diffusion of information to the group as a whole. Fourth, we develop an online lab experiment to further study the network mechanisms that widen inter-group differences and yield different returns on social capital to different groups. We recruit individuals to play an online collaborative game in which they have to find and dig gold mines and in the process can pass information to their network neighbors. By changing the network structure and composition of groups with low and high initial advantage, we generate the processes that lead to unequal distribution of opportunities, beyond what’s expected by individual differences. Finally, we contribute to the literature on network structure and performance and propose the concept of bandwidth-diversity matching: individuals who match the tie strength to their contacts with their information novelty achieve truly diverse networks and better outcomes.

**Bio:**I am a PhD candidate in the Social and Engineering Systems program at MIT IDSS, under supervision of Prof. Pentland and Prof. Eckles. I am also receiving a second PhD in Statistics from the Statistics and Data Science Center at MIT. I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer Science both from the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor.  
My PhD research is focused on micro-level structural factors, such as network structure, that contribute to unequal distribution of resources or information. As a computational social scientist, I use methods from network science, statistics, experiment design and causal inference. I am also interested in understanding the collective behavior in institutional settings, the institutional mechanisms that promote cooperative behavior in networks, or in contrast lead to unequal outcomes for different groups.  
In a previous life, I worked at Google New York City as a software engineer from 2011 to 2015. Currently, I am also a research contractor at Facebook working on how networks affect economic outcomes.

**Talk Title:**What and How Students Read: A Data-driven Insight

**Talk Abstract:**Reading is an integral part of learning. The purpose of reading to learn is to comprehend meaning from informational texts. Reading comprehension tasks require self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviors – to plan, monitor, and evaluate one’s reading strategies. Students without SRL skills may struggle in reading which in turn may inhibit them to acquire domain-specific knowledge. Thus, understanding students reading behavior and SRL usage is important for intervention. Digital reading platforms can provide opportunities to learn and practice SRL strategies in classroom settings. These platforms log rich array of student and teacher interaction data with the systems. Retrospective analysis of these logged data can derive insights– which can be used to support tailored interventions by instructors and students in complex learning activities. In this talk, I will discuss students’ science reading and SRL behaviors, and connect those behaviors with performance within a digital literacy platform, Actively Learn. The talk consists of two studies (i) identifying patterns that differ between productive and unproductive students (iI) analyzing the association of teachers’ behavior and students’ SRL usage. I will finish my talk by underlying possible future directions.

**Bio:**Effat Farhana is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Computer Science Department at North Carolina State University working with Dr. Collin F. Lynch in the ArgLab research group. She received her B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Her research focuses on mining educational software to derive data-driven heuristics, machine learning, and designing interpretable machine learning algorithms.

**Talk Title:** Quantifying The Power of Mental Shortcuts in Persuasive Communication with Causal Inference from Text

**Talk Abstract:** The reliance of individuals on mental shortcuts based on factors such as gender, affiliation, and social status could distort the equitability of interpersonal discussions in various settings. Yet, the impact of such shortcuts in real-world discussions remains challenging to quantify. In this talk, I propose a novel quasi-experimental study that incorporates unstructured text in a principled manner to quantify the causal effect of status indicators in persuasive communication. I also examine how linguistic and rhetorical devices moderate this effect, and thus provide communication strategies to potentially reduce individuals’ reliance on mental shortcuts. I discuss implications for fair communication policies both within organizations and in society at large.

**Bio:** Emaad Manzoor is a PhD candidate in the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, and will begin as an assistant professor of Operations and Information Management at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Fall 2021. Substantively, he designs randomized experiments and quasi-experimental studies to quantify the persuasive power of mental shortcuts in text-based communication, and how language can be used to moderate this power. Methodologically, he develops data-mining techniques for evolving networks and statistical frameworks for causal inference with text. He is funded by a 2020 McKinsey & Company PhD Fellowship, and was a finalist for the 2019 Snap Research PhD Fellowship, the 2019 Jane Street Depth First Learning Fellowship, and the 2019 INFORMS Annual Meeting Best Paper award.

# Emily Aiken

PhD Candidate, University of California, Berkeley

**Bio:**Emily is a PhD candidate at the UC Berkeley School of Information, where she studies the application of novel algorithms and digital data sources for social protection programs in low-income countries. Her work has been published in venues including Nature and Science Advances, and she is a recipient of a Microsoft Research PhD fellowship. Prior to Berkeley, Emily received her bachelor’s degree in computer science from Harvard.

**Talk Title:** Targeting humanitarian aid with machine learning and digital data

**Abstract:**The vast majority of humanitarian aid and social protection programs globally are targeted, providing assistance to individuals or communities identified to be poorest or most in need. In low and middle-income countries, the targeting of aid programs is often limited by low-quality, out-of-date, or missing data on poverty and vulnerability. Novel “big” digital data sources, such as those captured by satellites, mobile phones, and financial services providers — when combined with advances in machine learning — can improve the accuracy of aid program targeting. In this talk, I will cover empirical results on the accuracy of these new data-driven and algorithmic approaches to aid allocation, and will discuss emergent implications for fairness, privacy, transparency, and community dynamics.

# Faidra Monachou

Currently: Postdoctoral Fellow, Harvard University; Upcoming: Assistant Professor, Yale University; Previously: PhD Candidate, Stanford University

**Talk Title:**Discrimination, Diversity, and Information in Selection Problems

**Talk Abstract:**Despite the large empirical literature on disparities in college admissions, our theoretical understanding is limited. In this talk, I will introduce a theoretical framework to study how a decision-maker concerned with both merit and diversity, selects candidate students under imperfect information, limited capacity, and legal constraints. Motivated by recent decisions to drop standardized testing in admissions, we apply this framework to study how information differences lead to disparities across equally skilled groups and quantify the trade-off between information and access in test-free and test-based policies with and without affirmative action. Using application and transcript data from the University of Texas at Austin, we illustrate that there exist practical settings where dropping standardized testing improves or worsens both merit and diversity. Furthermore, we extend this model to demonstrate how privilege differences lead to intra-group disparities and establish that the direction of discrimination at the observable level may differ from the unobservable level. We compare common policies used in practice and take an optimization approach to design an optimal policy under legal constraints.

# Francesco Pinto

Postdoctoral Scholar, Data Science Institute

Francesco Pinto is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Data-Science Institute, University of Chicago, with expertise in AI Security and Trustworthiness. His research focuses on enhancing the safety and capabilities of Multimodal Agentic Large Language Models. As a member of the Secure Learning Lab, he works with Professor Bo Li on the development of safer Multiagent Multimodal Systems. Additionally, he serves as an advisor to the Lapis Lab at UIUC and Torr Vision Group at the University of Oxford, where he mentors students on independent research projects aligned with his area of expertise.

Since humans develop their intelligence by processing multimodal environmental stimuli and interacting with other humans, he believes machine intelligence can be achieved by processing multimodal data and interacting with other agents and environments. In order to foster their safe development, his research focuses on how to use training and inference algorithms, data synthesis techniques and multi-agent interaction flows to: (1) reduce hallucinations and biases in predictions, especially in previously unseen conditions (distribution-shift); (2) prevent the leakage of memorized data for privacy and copyright protection; and (3) mitigating societal harm by blocking harmful requests and steering models behavior.

Francesco earned his PhD from the University of Oxford, where he was advised by Prof. Philip Torr, Atılım Güneş Baydin, Victor Prisacariu and informally advised by Dr. Puneet Dokania. Many of his projects are developed in collaboration with industry, and have covered topics such as the evaluation, auditing and development of Multimodal Large Language Models (Meta FAIR/GenAI, Google, BBC), and the development of reliable models for autonomous driving systems (FiveAI/Bosch) and satellite collision management procedures (Trilium Tech/European Space Agency). During his PhD he also visited the Statistical Machine Learning group at ETH Zurich, where he collaborated with Prof. Fanny Yang and Amartya Sanyal to produce better Privacy Preserving training algorithms.

# Georgios Valogiannis

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Georgios Valogiannis is a cosmologist whose research focuses on the development and implementation of analytical and computational approaches to fully leverage upcoming large scale survey data and decipher the properties of physical theories underlying critical open questions in cosmology. These include the nature of the accelerated expansion of the universe, dark matter, massive neutrinos, the physics of the early universe and the properties of gravity at large scales. Valogiannis’ research also involves active collaborative engagement and leadership activities in two key cosmological surveys: the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC).

Despite the tremendous promise held by these ambitious observational endeavors in the era of precision cosmology, a full exploitation of the information encoded in the 3-dimensional cosmic web is highly nontrivial. Motivated by this challenge, Valogiannis’ latest research has been focused on the development and application of novel estimators that enable an efficient and reliable extraction of the non-Gaussian cosmological information that lies beyond the standard power spectrum. Such an approach has been, for instance, the wavelet scattering transform.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly made inroads in precision cosmology. As a Schmidt Fellow at the University of Chicago, Valogiannis plans to develop a research agenda that will be focused on identifying novel pathways through which AI can allow researchers to fully exploit the tremendous information that is encoded in the large-scale structure of the universe, in combination with data from the next generation of cosmic galaxy surveys.

**BIO**:

Starting from September 2023, Georgia’s Valogiannis is an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. Before coming to Chicago, Valogiannis was a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Physics at Harvard University, working in Prof. Cora Dvorkin’s group. Prior to that, Valogiannis obtained a PhD in the Department of Astronomy at Cornell University in 2020, under the supervision of Prof. Rachel Bean.

**Talk Title:**Safety-Critical Learning and Control in Dynamic Environments: Towards Unified Theory and Learned Robotic Agility

**Talk Abstract:**Deep-learning-based methods have made exciting progress in many decision-making problems such as playing complicated strategy games. However, for complex real-world settings, such as agile robotic control in hazardous or poorly-sensed environments (e.g., autonomous driving), end-to-end deep-learning-based methods are often unreliable. In this talk, I will first present the Neural-Control Family, which is a family of nonlinear deep-learning-based control methods with stability, safety, and robustness guarantees. The Neural-Control Family bridges learning and control theory in a unified framework, and demonstrates new capabilities in agile robot control (e.g., agile flight maneuvers in unknown strong wind conditions). In the second part, I will discuss progress towards establishing clean interfaces that fundamentally connect learning and control. A strong focus will be on non-asymptotic analysis for online learning and control. In particular, we will discuss the intersection of representation learning and adaptive control, no-regret and competitive control, and safe exploration in dynamical systems.

# Hae Kyung Im

Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Section of Genetic Medicine and Department of Human Genetics

Hae Kyung Im is an Associate Professor in the Section of Genetic Medicine and the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Chicago. She trained in Physics at the Instituto Balseiro, a center of excellence Science and Engineering in Argentina, and later earned her PhD in Statistics from the University of Chicago. After exploring research in manufacturing and consulting in information security and finance, she found her calling in statistical genetics.

She develops computational methods to make sense of large amounts of genomic and other high-dimensional data to make discoveries that can be translated into improving human health. To translate GWAS findings into actionable target genes, she developed and implemented an approach that uses genotype data to predict gene expression levels. The resulting system, a first-in-class gene-based association method called PrediXcan, expanded the test unit from genetic variants to more biologically meaningful units such as genes. Her publication of PrediXcan inspired similar approaches, creating a new class of methods now known as TWAS.

She has a strong track record of developing and sharing impactful methods with the community. Many research groups in academia, pharmaceutical companies, and biotech start-ups use her tools to interpret GWAS results and identify actionable disease targets. Committed to open science, she releases preprints of manuscripts and makes tools publicly available early on.

# Haojian Jin

Currently: Assistant Professor, UC San Diego, Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI); Previously: PhD Candidate, Carnegie Mellon University

**Bio:**Haojian Jin is a final year Ph.D. student in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Jason Hong and Swarun Kumar. Haojian’s research explores new software architecture and toolkits that make it easier for users, developers, and auditors to protect users’ privacy. His work has been recognized with a UbiComp Gaetano Borriello Outstanding Student Award, Research Highlights at Communication of ACM and GetMobile, and best paper awards at Ubicomp and ACM Computing Reviews.

**Talk Title:**My Data is None of Your Business: Separation of Concerns for Privacy through Modular Privacy Flows.

**Talk Abstract:**This wide-scale deployment of tiny sensors, coupled with improvements in recognition and data mining algorithms, will enable numerous new applications for personal and societal benefits. But, we have also seen many undesired data-driven applications deployed, such as price discrimination, shopping behavior persuasion. Once one’s data is out of users’ direct control, it may potentially be used at places and times far removed from its original context. How can we computer scientists assure users that a data-driven world is the one everyone wants to live in?

In this talk, I will introduce my thesis work on separating concerns for privacy through a new software design pattern, named Modular Privacy Flows. Rather than continuing to build privacy support in an ad-hoc manner, my research demonstrates how we can separate the privacy logic from the application logic. This separation can help users gain independent and unified control of their data while reducing the burdens of developers and auditors on ensuring privacy.

**Talk Title:** Understanding scientific fields via network analysis and topic modeling

**Talk Abstract:** As scientific disciplines get larger and more complex, it becomes impossible for an individual researcher to be familiar with the entire body of literature. This forces them to specialize in a sub-field, and unfortunately such insulation can hinder the birth of ideas that arise from new connections, eventually slowing down scientific progress. As such, discovering fruitful interdisciplinary connections by analyzing scientific publications is an important problem in the science of science. This talk will present several past and ongoing projects towards answering that question using tools from network analysis and topic modeling: 1) a dynamic-embedding-based method for link prediction in a machine learning/AI semantic network, 2) finding communities in cognitive science that study similar topics but do not cite each other or publish in the same venues, and 3) developing theoretically grounded hypergraph embedding methods to capture surprising collaborations or missed opportunities.

# Helen Qu

PhD Candidate, University of Pennsylvania

**Bio:** I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Physics at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Dr. Masao Sako. I work with type Ia supernovae as cosmological probes as part of the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration as well as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope supernova science investigation team. I am particularly interested in applications of machine learning and other modern data science techniques to large-scale astronomical survey data.

**Talk Title:** A Convolutional Neural Network Approach to Supernova Classification

**Talk Abstract:** One of the brightest objects in the universe, supernovae are powerful explosions marking the end of a star’s lifetime. Supernova type is defined by spectroscopic emission lines, but obtaining spectroscopy is often logistically unfeasible. Thus, the ability to identify supernovae by type using time-series image data alone is crucial, especially in light of the increasing breadth and depth of upcoming telescopes. We present a convolutional neural network method for fast supernova time-series classification, with observed brightness data smoothed in both the wavelength and time directions with Gaussian process regression. We apply this method to full duration and truncated supernova time-series, to simulate retrospective as well as real-time classification performance. Retrospective classification is used to differentiate cosmologically useful Type Ia supernovae from other supernova types, and this method achieves > 99% accuracy on this task. We are also able to differentiate between 6 supernova types with 60% accuracy given only two nights of data and 98% accuracy retrospectively.

**Talk Title:**Adversarial Collusion on the Web: State-of-the-art and Future Directions

**Talk Abstract:**The growth and popularity of online media have made it the most important platform for collaboration and communication among its users. Given its tremendous growth, the social reputation of an entity in online media plays an important role. This has led to users choosing artificial ways to gain social reputation by means of blackmarket services as the natural way to boost social reputation is time-consuming. We refer to such artificial ways of boosting social reputation as collusion. In this talk, we will comprehensively review recent developments in analyzing and detecting collusive entities on online media. First, we give an overview of the problem and motivate the need to detect these entities. Second, we survey the state-of-the-art models that range from designing feature-based methods to more complex models, such as using deep learning architectures and advanced graph concepts. Third, we detail the annotation guidelines, provide a description of tools/applications and explain the publicly available datasets. The talk concludes with a discussion of future trends.

**Bio:**Hridoy Sankar Dutta is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT-Delhi, India. Starting January 2021, he will be joining University of Cambridge as a Research Assistant in the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre. His current research interests include data-driven cybersecurity, social network analysis, natural language processing, and applied machine learning. He received his B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Institute of Science and Technology, Gauhati University, India in 2013. From 2014 to 2015, he worked as an Assistant Project Engineer at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati (IIT-G), India, for the project ‘Development of Text to Speech System in Assamese and Manipuri Languages’.

# James Evans

Professor of Sociology; Director, Knowledge Lab; Faculty Co-Director, Complementary AI

My research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture—novelty, ambiguity, topology—of understanding. I am especially interested in innovation—how new ideas and practices emerge—and the role that social and technical institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations) play in collective cognition and discovery. Much of my work has focused on areas of modern science and technology, but I am also interested in other domains of knowledge—news, law, religion, gossip, hunches, machine and historical modes of thinking and knowing. I support the creation of novel observatories for human understanding and action through crowd sourcing, information extraction from text and images, and the use of distributed sensors (e.g., RFID tags, cell phones). I use machine learning, generative modeling, social and semantic network representations to explore knowledge processes, scale up interpretive and field-methods, and create alternatives to current discovery regimes.

My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Air Force office of Science Research, and many philanthropic sources, and has been published in *Nature*, *Science*, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Science*, *American Journal of Sociology*, *American Sociological Review*, *Social Studies of Science*, *Research Policy, Critical Theory,**Administrative Science Quarterly*, and other outlets. My work has been featured in the *Economist*, *Atlantic Monthly*, *Wired*, *NPR*, *BBC*, *El País*, *CNN, Le Monde,*and many other outlets.

At Chicago, I am Director of [Knowledge Lab](http://www.knowledgelab.org/), which has collaborative, granting and employment opportunities, as well as ongoing seminars. I also founded and now direct on the Computational Social Science program at Chicago, and sponsor an associated Computational Social Science workshop. I teach courses in augmented intelligence, the history of modern science, science studies, computational content analysis, and Internet and Society. Before Chicago, I received my doctorate in sociology from Stanford University, served as a research associate in the Negotiation, Organizations, and Markets group at Harvard Business School, started a private high school focused on project-based arts education, and completed a B. A. in Anthropology at Brigham Young University.

# Jeffrey Negrea

Currently: Postdoctoral Scholar, Data Science Institute; Upcoming: Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo and Faculty Affiliate, Vector Institute; Previously: PhD Candidate, University of Toronto

**Bio:**Jeffrey Negrea is a 5th year Ph.D. candidate and Vanier scholar at the University of Toronto in the department of Statistical Sciences, and a graduate student researcher at the Vector Institute, working with Daniel Roy on foundational problems in computational statistics, machine learning, and sequential decision making. His research focuses on questions of reliability and robustness for statistical and machine learning methods. His contributions are broad: he has recent work addressing robustness to the IID assumption in sequential decision making, the role of regularization in statistical learning, the connection between stochastic optimization and uncertainty quantification, and approximation methods in MCMC. Previously, Jeff completed his B.Math. at the University of Waterloo, and his M.Sc. in Statistics at the University of Toronto.

**Talk Title:**Adapting to failure of the IID assumption for sequential prediction

**Talk Abstract:** We consider sequential prediction with expert advice when data are generated from distributions varying arbitrarily within an unknown constraint set. We quantify relaxations of the classical IID assumption in terms of these constraint sets, with IID sequences at one extreme and adversarial mechanisms at the other. The Hedge algorithm, long known to be minimax optimal in the adversarial regime, was recently shown to be minimax optimal for IID data. We show that Hedge with deterministic learning rates is suboptimal between these extremes, and present new algorithms that adaptively achieve the minimax optimal rate of regret with respect to our relaxations of the IID assumption, and do so without knowledge of the underlying constraint set. We analyze our algorithm using the follow-the-regularized-leader framework, and prove it corresponds to Hedge with adaptive learning rates.

**Talk Title:**AI for Science: Learning from Experts and Data

**Talk Abstract:**In many fields, the amount of recorded scientific data is increasing much faster than the speed at which researchers can analyze and interpret them. For example, recorded videos of animal behavior over a few days can take domain experts months to analyze. Innovations in data science, such as machine learning, provide a promising direction to enable scientists to scalably perform data-driven experiments. However, scientific applications raise a number of challenges for existing methods: data creation is expensive, model interpretability is important, and tools are often needed to translate algorithmic improvements to practical benefits.

To address these challenges, my current work has focused on incorporating domain knowledge into machine learning to reduce human effort for data analysis. I will discuss methods to improve the sample-efficiency and interpretability of models in the context of behavior modeling. To learn annotation-sample efficient representations, we developed a framework to unify self-supervision with weak programmatic supervision from domain experts. We demonstrated that our method reduces annotation requirements up to a factor of 10 without compromising accuracy, compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, we investigate program synthesis as a promising direction to produce interpretable descriptions of behavior. We integrate interpretable programs from our method with an existing tool in behavioral neuroscience. These interdisciplinary approaches of machine learning with experts in the loop are important to broaden the application of data science across scientific domains.

**Talk Title:** Algorithmic Foundation of Fair Graph Mining

**Talk Abstract:** Graphs are ubiquitous in many real-world applications. To date, researchers have developed a plethora of theories, algorithms and systems that are successful in answering what and who questions on graphs. Despite the remarkable progress, unfairness often occurs in many graph mining algorithms, hindering the deployment of graph mining algorithms in high-stake applications. To make graph mining process and its results fair, it is crucial to propose a paradigm shift, from answering what and who to understanding how and why. Four desired properties (i.e., utility, fairness, transparency and robustness) are called for in order to build an algorithmic foundation of fair graph mining. In this talk, I will present our efforts in building the algorithmic foundation of fair graph mining by addressing the tensions among the desired properties. First, we present a generic algorithmic framework to understand how the graph mining results relate to the input graph. Second, we systematically study the individual fairness on graph mining, including the measurement, mitigation strategies and cost. Finally, we analyze the root cause of degree-related unfairness in graph neural networks and present a family of debiasing algorithms, followed by my thoughts about the future work.

**Talk Title:**Theoretical Insights into Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent in Deep Learning

**Abstract:**Gradient Descent (GD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are fundamental optimization algorithms in machine learning, but their behaviors sometimes defy intuitions from classic optimization and statistical learning theories. In deep learning, GD often exhibits local oscillations while still converging over time. Moreover, SGD-trained models generalize effectively even when overparameterized. In this talk, I will revisit the theories of GD and SGD for classic problems but in new scenarios motivated by deep learning, presenting two novel insights:

(1) For logistic regression with separable data, GD with an arbitrarily large stepsize minimizes empirical risk, potentially in a non-monotonic fashion.

(2) For linear regression and ReLU regression, one-pass SGD and its variants can achieve low excess risk, even in overparameterized regime.

**Talk Title:** Modeling and Correcting Bias in Sequential Evaluation

**Talk Abstract:** We consider the problem of sequential evaluation in applications such as hiring and competitions, in which an evaluator observes candidates in a sequence and assigns scores to these candidates in an online, irrevocable fashion. Motivated by the psychology literature that has studied sequential bias in such settings — namely, dependencies between the evaluation outcome and the order in which the candidates appear — we propose a natural model for the evaluator’s rating process that captures the lack of calibration inherent to such a task. We conduct crowdsourcing experiments to demonstrate various facets of our model. We then proceed to study how to correct sequential bias under our model by posing this as a statistical inference problem. We propose a near-linear time, online algorithm for this task and prove guarantees in terms of two canonical ranking metrics. We also prove that our algorithm is information theoretically optimal, by establishing matching lower bounds in both metrics. Finally, we show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the de facto method of naively using the rankings induced by the reported scores.

**Talk Title:**The Measure and Mismeasure of Fairness

**Abstract:** The field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last decade, several formal, mathematical definitions of fairness have gained prominence. Here we first  
assemble and categorize these definitions into two broad families: (1) those that constrain the effects of decisions on disparities; and (2) those that constrain the effects of legally protected characteristics, like race and gender, on decisions. We then show, analytically and empirically, that both families of definitions typically result in strongly Pareto dominated decision policies. For example, in the case of college admissions, adhering to popular formal conceptions of fairness would simultaneously result in lower student-body diversity and a less academically prepared class, relative to what one could achieve by explicitly tailoring admissions policies to achieve desired outcomes. In this sense, requiring that these fairness definitions hold can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect. In contrast to axiomatic notions of fairness, we argue that the equitable design of algorithms requires grappling with their context-specific consequences, akin to the equitable design of policy. We conclude by listing several open challenges in fair machine learning and offering strategies to ensure algorithms are better aligned with policy goals.

# Jordan Fuhrman

Currently: PhD Candidate, Medical Physics, The University of Chicago

**Talk Title:**Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Thoracic CT Scans Through Multiple Instance Transfer Learning

**Talk Abstract:**Computer-aided diagnosis systems have demonstrated significant potential in improving patient care and clinical outcomes by providing more extensive information to clinicians.  The development of these systems typically requires a large amount of well-annotated data, which can be challenging to acquire in medical imaging.  Several techniques have been investigated in an attempt to overcome insufficient data, including transfer learning, or the application of a pre-trained model to a new domain and/or task.  The successful translation of transfer learning models to complex medical imaging problems holds significant potential and could lead to widespread clinical implementation.

However, transfer learning techniques often fail translate effectively because they are limited by the domain in which they were initially trained.  For example, computed tomography (CT) is a powerful medical imaging modality that leverages 3D images in clinical decision-making, but transfer learning models are typically trained on 2D images and thus can not incorporate the additional information provided by the third dimension.  This evaluation of the available data in a CT scan is inefficient and potentially does not effectively improve clinical decisions.  In this project, the 3D information available in CT scans is combined incorporated with transfer learning through a multiple instance learning (MIL) scheme, which can individually assess 2D images and form a collective 3D prediction based on the 2D information, similar to how a radiologist would read a CT scan.  This approach has been applied to evaluate both COVID-19 and emphysema in CT thoracic CT scans and demonstrated strong clinical potential.

**Bio:**Jordan Fuhrman is a student in the Graduate Program in Medical Physics at the University of Chicago. Since joining the program after his graduation from the University of Alabama in 2017, Jordan’s research has focused on the investigation of computer-aided diagnosis techniques for evaluating CT scans. Generally, this includes implementation of machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to accomplish such tasks as disease detection, image segmentation, and prognosis assessments. His primary research interests lie in the development of novel approaches that incorporate the full wealth of information in CT scans to better inform clinical predictions, the exploration of explainable, interpretable outputs to improve clinical understanding of deep learning algorithm performance, and the early detection and prediction of patient progress to inform clinical decisions (e.g., most appropriate treatment) and improve patient outcomes. His work has largely focused on incidental disease assessment in low-dose CT lung screening scans, including emphysema, osteoporosis, and coronary artery calcifications, but has also included non-screening scan assessments of hypoxic ischemic brain injury and COVID-19. Jordan is a student member of both the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and the Society of Photo-optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

# Joshua Conrad Jackson

Neubauer Family Assistant Professor of Behavioral Science, Booth School of Business

Joshua Conrad Jackson is an assistant professor of Behavioral Science at the Booth School of Business, where he teaches strategies and processes of negotiation.

In his research, Josh studies how culture co-evolves with psychology. He is interested in how culture has shaped the mind throughout human history, and how it continues to shape human futures. His studies consider the deep past, uncovering how historical patterns of migration, warfare, and urbanization have influenced human [emotion](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/366/6472/1517.full.pdf?ijkey=lJTEu2hV5YwZ2&keytype=ref&siteid=sci "This Link Opens in New Window"), [moral psychology](https://psyarxiv.com/sx4rt/ "This Link Opens in New Window"), and [religion](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/s/Jackson-et-al-2021-JEPG.pdf " - This Link Opens in New Window"). He also examines how contemporary trends like the [rise of algorithms](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/s/Yam-et-al-2023-JAP-Robot.pdf " - This Link Opens in New Window"), [climate change](https://theconversation.com/could-climate-change-fuel-the-rise-of-right-wing-nationalism-123503 "This Link Opens in New Window"), and [economic inequality](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/s/Jackson-and-Payne-Cognitive-Barriers.pdf " - This Link Opens in New Window") could impact people’s beliefs, values, and prejudices.

Many public policy issues lie at the intersection of cultural evolution and psychology, and Josh tries to highlight these connections to policy. He has published papers explaining [why support for political leaders surged during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/s/COVID-world-leaders.pdf " - This Link Opens in New Window"), [why populist leaders swept through Europe in the early 21st century](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/s/Jackson-Plos-One-2019.pdf " - This Link Opens in New Window"), and [how social media algorithms could contribute to political polarization and false beliefs](https://osf.io/yw5ah/ "This Link Opens in New Window").

Josh has published papers in *Science, Nature Human Behavior, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Psychological Science,*and *Annual Review of Psychology*. He has also written for *Huffington Post, LA Times,* and*Scientific American**.*He won the Sage Emerging Scholar Award from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, the Dissertation Award from the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, and the Society for Cross-Cultural Research’s John and Beatrice Whiting Award for Outstanding Graduate Student.

Before joining Booth, Josh was a DRRC postdoctoral research fellow in the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

# Laixi Shi

PhD Candidate, Carnegie Mellon University

**Bio:** Laixi Shi is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, fortunately advised by Prof. Yuejie Chi. She has also interned at Google Research Brain Team and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories. Her research interests include reinforcement learning (RL), non-convex optimization, high-dimensional statistical estimation, and signal processing, ranging from theory to applications. Her current research focuses on 1) theoretical works: designing provable sample-efficient algorithms for value-based RL, offline RL, and robust RL problems, resorting to optimization and statistics; 2) practical works: reinforcement learning algorithms (DRL) on different large-scale problems such as Atari games, web navigation and etc.

**Talk Title:** Provable Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning: Efficiency and Robustness

**Talk Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success recently to deal with unknown environments and maximize some long-term cumulative rewards. Contemporary reinforcement learning has to deal with unknown environments with unprecedentedly large dimensionality. In order to fundamentally understand and improve the effectiveness of RL algorithms in high dimensions, a recent body of work sought to develop a finite-sample theoretical framework to analyze the algorithms of interest. My work belongs to this recent line of delineating the dependency of algorithm performance on salient parameters in a non-asymptotic fashion in different RL settings. Besides maximizing the expected total reward, perhaps an equally important goal—to say the least— for an RL agent is safety and robustness, especially in high-stake applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, clinical trials, financial investments, and so on. Inspired by the robustness requirement, in this talk, we introduce our work on distributional robust RL with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the distance, referring to the problem of learning an optimal policy that is robust to future environment perturbations. I will introduce our proposed robust RL algorithm, which to the best of our knowledge is the first near-optimal algorithm for this problem, which matches the minimax lower bound up to a polynomial factor of the effective horizon length.

**Talk Title:**Distribution-Free Assessment of Population Overlap in Observational Studies

**Talk Abstract:**Overlap in baseline covariates between treated and control groups, also known as positivity or common support, is one of the most fundamental assumptions in observational causal inference. Assessing this assumption is often ad hoc, however, and can give misleading results. For example, the common practice of examining the empirical distribution of estimated propensity scores is heavily dependent on model specification and has poor uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we propose a formal statistical framework for assessing the extrema of the population propensity score; e.g., the propensity score lies in [0.1, 0.9] almost surely. We develop a family of upper confidence bounds, which we term O-values, for this quantity. We show these bounds are valid in finite samples so long as the observations are independent and identically distributed, without requiring any further modeling assumptions on the data generating process. We also use extensive simulations to show that these bounds are reasonably tight in practice. Finally, we demonstrate this approach using several benchmark observational studies, showing how to build our proposed method into the observational causal inference workflow.

# Lingjiao Chen

PhD Candidate, Stanford University

**Bio:**Lingjiao Chen is a PhD candidate in the computer sciences department at Stanford University. He is broadly interested in machine learning, data management and optimization. Working with Matei Zaharia and James Zou, he is currently exploring the fast-growing marketplaces of artificial intelligence and data. His work has been published at premier conferences and journals such as ICML, NeurIPS, SIGMOD and PVLDB, and partially supported by a Google fellowship.

**Talk Title:**Understanding and Exploiting Machine Learning Prediction APIs

**Talk Abstract:**Machine Learning (ML) prediction APIs are a fast-growing industry and an important part of ML as a service. For example, one could use Google prediction API to classify an image for $0.0015 or to classify the sentiment of a text passage for $0.00025. While many such services are available, the heterogeneity in their price and performance makes it challenging for users to decide which API or combination of APIs to use for their own data.

In this talk, I will present FrugalML, a principled framework that jointly learns the strength and weakness of each API on different data, and performs an efficient optimization to automatically identify the best sequential strategy to adaptively use the available APIs within a budget constraint. Our theoretical analysis shows that natural sparsity in the formulation can be leveraged to make FrugalML efficient. We conduct systematic experiments using ML APIs from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Baidu and other providers for tasks including facial emotion recognition, sentiment analysis and speech recognition. Across various tasks, FrugalML can achieve up to 90% cost reduction while matching the accuracy of the best single API, or up to 5% better accuracy while matching the best API’s cost. If time permits, I will also discuss recent follow-up studies on API performance shifts and multi-label APIs.

**Talk Title:**How to Preserve Privacy in Data Analysis?

**Talk Abstract:**The past decade has witnessed the tremendous success of large-scale data science. However, recent studies show that many existing powerful machine learning tools used in large-scale data science pose severe threats to personal privacy. Therefore, one of the major challenges in data analysis is how to learn effectively from the enormous amounts of sensitive data without giving up on privacy. Differential Privacy (DP) has recently emerged as a new gold standard for private data analysis due to the statistical data privacy it can provide for sensitive information. Nevertheless, the adaptation of DP to data analysis remains challenging due to the complex models we often encountered in data analysis. In this talk, I will focus on two commonly used models, i.e., the centralized and distributed/federated models, for differentially private data analysis. For the centralized model, I will present my efforts to provide strong privacy and utility guarantees in high-dimensional data analysis. For the distributed/federated model, I will discuss new efficient and effective privacy-preserving learning algorithms.

**Bio:**Lingxiao Wang is a final year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by Dr. Quanquan Gu. Previously he obtained his MS degree in Statistics at the University of Washington.

**Talk Title:**Exploiting Prior Knowledge in Physical World Incorporated with Machine Learning for Solving Medical Imaging Problems

**Talk Abstract:**Medical imaging is crucial for image-guided clinical patient care. In my research of the interdisciplinary area in medical AI, I develop efficient machine learning algorithms for medical imaging by exploiting prior knowledge from the physical world — exploit what you know — to incorporate with machine learning models.

I present two main directions of my research. First, since the data-driven machine learning methods always suffer from limitations in generalizability, reliability and interpretability, By exploiting geometry and physics priors from the imaging system, I proposed physics-aware and geometry-informed deep learning frameworks for radiation-reduced sparse-view CT and accelerated MR imaging. Incorporating geometry and physics priors, the trained deep networks show more robust generalization across patients and better interpretability. Second, motivated by the unique characteristics of medical images that patients are often scanned serially over time during clinical treatment, where earlier images provide abundant prior knowledge of the patient’s anatomy, I proposed a prior embedding method to encode internal information of image priors through coordinate-based neural representation learning. Since this method requires no training data from external subjects, it relaxes the burden of data collection, and can be easily generalized across different imaging modalities and anatomies. Following this, I developed a novel algorithm of temporal neural representation learning for longitudinal study. Combining both physics priors and image priors, I showed proposed algorithm can successfully capture subtle yet significant structure changes such as tumor progression in sparse-sampling image reconstruction, which can be applied to tackle real-world challenges in cancer patients treatment and radiation therapy.

# Lucy Li

PhD Candidate, University of California, Berkeley

**Bio:**Lucy Li is a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, working on natural language processing (NLP), computational social science, cultural analytics, and AI fairness. She researches how social groups are discussed and represented in language models and textual data, such as textbooks, fiction, and online forums. She is passionate about bridging NLP with the humanities and social sciences, especially education and curriculum studies. She is supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and has interned at Microsoft Research and the Allen Institute for AI, the latter which awarded her Outstanding Intern of the Year.

**Talk Title:**Measuring Language By Social Groups in Natural Language Processing

**Abstract:**Language data embeds social identities, behaviors, and beliefs. That is, who we are is expressed through how we communicate. My research leverages natural language processing (NLP) methods to measure large-scale language patterns across social groups, and uses these measurements to answer sociolinguistic questions and inform model development. First, I’ll present studies quantifying community-specific words and meanings across two domains: online discussion forums and scholarly literature. In these studies, I leverage perspectives from sociolinguistics to relate communities’ use of distinctive language to various social factors, such as member loyalty, activity, network density, audience, and cross-community impact. Second, I’ll present an ongoing study analyzing the effects of large language model (LLM) pretraining data practices on text spanning a range of socioeconomic and geographic origins. Model developers often implement filters to extract “high-quality” data to train models. I’ll show whether notions of “quality” vary across popular LLMs’ filtering strategies, and what kinds of webtext are disproportionately removed during these curation processes. Finally, I will conclude by discussing challenges and questions raised by my research that point towards future directions for computational social science and NLP.

# Ludwig Schneider

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Ludwig Schneider’s goal is to design sustainable polymeric materials through combining material science, design, and engineering with AI. This involves three main objectives, including understanding the impact of monomeric chemistry, representing polymers as variable ensembles, and developing faster integration schemes for simulations, ultimately aiming to design new materials for the circular economy.

Schneider’s scientific background is focused on material science, design, and engineering, using MD simulations, statistical mechanics, and chemical informatics. Through the Schmidt Foundation for AI + Science, Schneider is combining expertise with AI to design sustainable polymeric materials and gain a deep understanding of the dynamics, rheology, and morphology of high-performing battery and membrane materials.

The scientific goal of Schneider’s research is to develop a fully in silico workflow that enables the design of sustainable polymeric materials, addressing the urgent problem of plastic pollution and contributing to the circular economy. In silico screening and design are essential to make this transition economically feasible.

Schneider’s mission encompasses three main objectives:

1. To achieve fundamental sustainable material design, experts need to understand the impact of monomeric chemistry. To achieve this, Schneider proposes high-throughput atomistic simulations combined with active learning to explore and understand the vast chemical space. A polymer-centric database is essential, and Schneider contributed to building CRIPT, a scientific FAIR data bank for polymer materials.
2. Representing polymers as variable ensembles of macromolecules is necessary for any machine learning method to work. Encoding the ensemble and chemical specificity is a formidable challenge, and Schneider proposes a new Ansatz that combines local chemical information with the molecular graph ensemble.
3. Developing faster integration schemes for simulations is essential. Schneider proposes to develop a kinetic Monte Carlo integrator that fulfills detailed balance irrespective of its trained state.

Schneider’s ultimate goal is to design new materials that are sustainable and contribute to the circular economy. Through an interdisciplinary approach, Schneider is taking significant steps towards achieving this goal.

**BIO**:

Ludwig Schneider is a computational material designer specializing in polymeric and soft matter. With a background in physics, he has combined his expertise in software engineering, chemistry, and data science for numerous research projects. Ludwig completed his undergraduate and graduate studies under the guidance of Prof. Müller at Georg-August University in Goettingen, Germany, where he studied rheology and structure formation in complex polymer melts.

After receiving his Ph.D. degree, Ludwig moved to Juan de Pablo’s group at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago, to broaden his skill set to include machine learning and chemistry. While at the University of Chicago, Ludwig’s research focus shifted towards Machine Learning and AI, where he developed automated simulations to explore the chemical space and find more sustainable plastic materials. He also developed methods to accelerate the time evolution prediction of high functioning nano-materials.

As an AI in Science Fellow of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Foundation, Ludwig’s primary goal is to build AI tools and promote the use of AI in Science. A prime example of his work is the creation of CRIPT, a data bank for polymeric materials that serves as a foundation for machine learning in polymer science.

**Talk Title:** Reasoning about Social Dynamics and Social Bias in Language

[Watch Maarten’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHIEl01UFss&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=8)

**Talk Abstract:** Humans easily make inferences to reason about the social and power dynamics of situations (e.g., stories about everyday interactions), but such reasoning is still a challenge for modern NLP systems. In this talk, I will address how we can make machines reason about social commonsense and social biases in text, and how this reasoning could be applied in downstream applications.

In the first part, I will discuss PowerTransformer, our new unsupervised model for controllable debiasing of text through the lens of connotation frames of power and agency. Trained using a combined reconstruction and paraphrasing objective, this model can rewrite story sentences such that its characters are portrayed with more agency and decisiveness. After establishing its performance through automatic and human evaluations, we show how PowerTransformer can be used to mitigate gender bias in portrayals of movie characters. Then, I will introduce Social Bias Frames, a conceptual formalism that models the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others to reason about biased or harmful implications in language. Using a new corpus of 150k structured annotations, we show that models can learn to reason about high-level offensiveness of statements, but struggle to explain why a statement might be harmful. I will conclude with future directions for better reasoning about social dynamics and social biases.

**Bio:** Maarten Sap is a final year PhD student in the University of Washington’s natural language processing (NLP) group, advised by Noah Smith and Yejin Choi. His research focuses on endowing NLP systems with social intelligence and social commonsense, and understanding social inequality and bias in language. In the past, he’s interned at AI2 on project Mosaic working on social commonsense reasoning, and at Microsoft Research working on long-term memory and storytelling with Eric Horvitz.

# Madeleine Torcasso

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Cellular dysfunction in human disease occurs in a complex, three-dimensional space. However, many state-of-the-art techniques for studying cells rely on the dissociation of tissue to parse cells one by one, destroying any spatial context about the cellular environment. Using novel staining and imaging techniques, researchers can now probe the cellular constituents of human tissue with higher phenotypic resolution than previously possible and capture over 40 cell markers in a single biopsy, while preserving the spatial organization of cells in tissue. Artificial intelligence (AI) is necessary for high throughput processing of this data, as humans have difficulty interpreting information from multiple imaging channels. In her work, Madeleine Torcasso develops and implements various AI methods for quantitative analysis of highly multiplexed microscopy images. Using AI, researchers can automatically find and characterize cells in high-content image data and extract spatial features describing the cellular organization of disease states. These spatial features might also be linked with clinical features such as therapy response or patient prognosis. Torcasso is particularly interested in exploring the spatial context of immunity in various pathogenic states, ranging from autoimmunity to cancer.

**BIO**:

Madeleine Torcasso is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Radiology at the University of Chicago. She received her bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Vanderbilt University in 2013 and her PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Texas A&M University in 2018. Her doctoral thesis focused on radiative transport modeling to help inform the design of optical imaging and sensing systems to detect disease in vivo. As a postdoc, she works with AI to quantify high-content optical microscopy images of human tissue samples. She is also interested in using AI to merge data from multiple imaging modalities to improve predictive models. In her free time, she likes to get away from the computer and run, hike, or walk; anything to stay active!

# Marie-Laure Charpignon

PhD Candidate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

**Bio:** Marie is a PhD candidate at MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, conducting research at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems and the Broad Institute. Her research combines statistical machine learning, causal inference, and network science, with applications in medicine and public health.

In particular, she builds disease-specific hypergraphs to formulate drug repurposing hypotheses and utilizes the target trial emulation framework to evaluate repurposing candidates for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias using structured (e.g., diagnosis codes) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes) from electronic health records, across multiple medical centers. Methodologically, her work involves the use of doubly-robust machine learning and causal matrix estimation and the development of synthetic control and instrumental variable approaches adapted to survival analysis. With a focus on aging populations, she also designs comprehensive agent-based models that integrate granular sociodemographic and mobility data to optimize the distribution of vaccines against infectious diseases at the state and national level and inform public policy decision-making.

Previously, Marie obtained a BSc in Engineering Sciences from Ecole Centrale Paris in France and a MSc in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University. As a data scientist at Microsoft, she analyzed the effects of technology usage and digital collaboration on student academic outcomes and socio-emotional learnings in school networks with treatment spillovers. She interned at Goldman Sachs, Microsoft Research, the European Commission, INSERM-INRIA in France, and Clalit Innovation in Israel.

**Talk Title:** Antihypertensive drug repurposing for dementia prevention: target trial emulations in two large-scale electronic health record systems

**Abstract:** Alzheimer’s disease (AD)—the most common type of dementia—affects 5.7 million people in the US and costs about $250 billion annually. Since there are no disease-modifying therapies to date, repurposing FDA-approved drugs preventing dementia onset offers an expedited path to reduce the impact of this epidemic. Beyond age, type 2 diabetes and hypertension are two major risk factors for dementia onset. However, mixed results are emerging from prior observational studies contrasting various antihypertensive drug classes, including Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), and Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB).

To address this complexity and evaluate the repurposing potential of antihypertensives with different mechanisms of action, we deployed a causal inference approach accounting for the competing risk of death in emulated clinical trials using two distinct electronic health record (EHR) systems, one from the UK Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) and the other from the US Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR). We performed intention-to-treat analyses among patients aged 50 or older at baseline, applying Inverse Propensity score of Treatment Weighting to balance the two treatment arms with respect to a set of confounders curated by cardiologists and neurologists. Specifically, we compared antihypertensive treatment initiation with any of seven ARBs vs any of eleven ACE inhibitors.

In the US RPDR database, a total of 45,206 patients were eligible to participate in the emulated target trial. Treatment initiation with any of the seven ARBs was associated with lower hazard of all-cause mortality (HR=1.16 [95% CI: 1.10-1.23]) and lower cause-specific hazard of dementia onset (HR=1.34 [95% CI: 1.27-1.42]) in cause-specific Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) models, after accounting for prolonged survival, relative to treatment initiation with any of the eleven ACE inhibitors. In addition, within the ARB drug class, the gap in the dementia risk difference over time was more pronounced among patients initiating on compounds that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Results of the competing risks analysis were robust to the structure of the outcome models (i.e., Cox PH vs nonparametric). The directionality and strength of our findings were similar in the UK CPRD database.

Target trial emulations in two large-scale EHR systems suggest that treatment initiation with BBB-crossing ARBs might reduce the risk of dementia among hypertensive patients. Ongoing work includes the conduct of a mediation analysis in the two considered cohorts to assess the role played by enhanced blood pressure control towards dementia prevention.

# Martin Falk

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

The goal of Martin Falk’s research is to create next-generation materials which can compute, morph, and continually adapt to their environments. However, identifying the rare designs that lead to such unusual behaviors requires searching through a combinatorially large number of fabrication and control protocols. To find these rare designs, Falk will draw on techniques from computer vision and active learning, developing AI agents capable of autonomous search and rigorous scientific discovery in novel material platforms.

**BIO**:

Martin Falk initially joined the University of Chicago in 2019 to work with Prof. Arvind Murugan as a postdoc in a MRSEC initiative focused on the creation of trainable materials. Prior, Falk’s Ph.D. was supervised in the MIT Physics department by Profs. Michael Brenner and Leonid Mirny on problems in polymer self-assembly. Falk received a B.A. in Math and Physics from the University of Pennsylvania in 2014, where Falk was advised by Profs. Tom Lubensky and Joe Subotnik.

# Martin Saveski

Currently: Postdoctoral Scholar, Stanford University; Upcoming: Assistant Professor, University of Washington

**Bio:**Martin Saveski is a postdoctoral scholar at the Management Science and Engineering department at Stanford University. He completed his Ph.D. from MIT in September 2020. Martin’s broad research area is Computational Social Science. He uses Causal Inference and Social Network Analyses to study pressing social problems online, such as political polarization and toxicity. He has also made methodological contributions in the areas of causal inference in networks, and recommender systems. Previously, he has interned at Facebook, LinkedIn, Amazon, and Yahoo. His work has been covered by major media outlets, including the New York Times, NPR, MIT Tech Review, and others.

**Talk Title:**Engaging Politically Diverse Audiences on Social Media

**Talk Abstract:**In this talk, I will present our study of how political polarization is reflected in the language used by media outlets to promote their content online and what we can do to reduce it. We tracked the Twitter posts of several media outlets over the course of more than three years (566K tweets), and the engagement with these tweets from other users (104M retweets). We then used this data to model the relationship between the tweet text and the political diversity of the audience. We built a tool that integrates our models and helps journalists craft tweets that are engaging to a politically diverse audience, guided by the model predictions. To test the real-world impact of the tool, we partnered with the award-winning PBS documentary series Frontline and ran a series of advertising experiments on Twitter testing how tens of thousands of users respond to the tweets. We found that in seven out of the ten experiments, the tweets selected by our model were indeed engaging to a more politically diverse audience, illustrating the effectiveness of our tool. I will close by discussing the methodological challenges and opportunities in using advertisements to test interventions on social media platforms.

# Matthew Stephens FRS

Department Chair, Statistics, Ralph W. Gerard Professor, Departments of Statistics and Human Genetics, and the College, Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics (CCAM)

My lab works on a wide variety of problems at the interface of Statistics and Genetics. We often tackle problems where novel statistical methods are required, or can learn something new compared with existing approaches. Thus, much of our research involves developing new statistical methodology, many of which have a non-trivial computational component. And because data sets are getting larger and larger our work often involves modern methods for “high-dimensional statistics”. Our work often makes extensive use of Bayesian hierarchical models to borrow information across data sets or sampling units.

My lab has also been increasingly focused on making its research more open, reproducible and extensible. This is because I see this as the first step towards greater cooperation of scientists to achieve common goals.

In learning to do research this way, my lab uses git for version control, github for sharing code, and Rmarkdown to help make our R analyses clear and share-able.

Current research interests include:

* Sparsity, shrinkage, and false discovery rates, particularly for complex inter-related datasets.
* Factor Analysis, dimension reduction, and estimation of large covariance matrices.
* Clustering methods, and generalizations (eg grade of membership)
* Applications of multi-scale and wavelet methods to genomic data
* Reproducible research and open science

**Talk Title:**Formal Logic Enhanced Deep Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems

[Watch Meiyi’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd8MP6va1i4&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=6)

**Talk Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks are broadly applied and have outstanding achievements for prediction and decision-making support for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). However, for large-scale and complex integrated CPS with high uncertainties, DNN models are not always robust, often subject to anomalies, and subject to erroneous predictions, especially when the predictions are projected into the future (uncertainty and errors grow over time). To increase the robustness of DNNs for CPS, in my work, I developed a novel formal logic enhanced learning framework with logic-based criteria to enhance DNN models to follow system critical properties and build well-calibrated uncertainty estimation models. Trained in an end-to-end manner with back-propagation, this framework is general and can be applied to various DNN models. The evaluation results on large-scale real-world city datasets show that my work not only improves the accuracy of predictions and effectiveness of uncertainty estimation, but importantly also guarantees the satisfaction of model properties and increases the robustness of DNNs. This work can be applied to a wide spectrum of applications, including the Internet of Things, smart cities, healthcare, and many others.

**Talk Title:** Malicious Attacks against Deep Reinforcement Learning Interpretations

**Talk Abstract:**The past years have witnessed the rapid development of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which incorporates deep learning into the solution and makes decisions from unstructured input data without manual engineering of the state space. However, the adoption of deep neural networks makes the decision-making process of DRL opaque and lacking transparency. Motivated by this, various interpretation methods for DRL have been proposed. Those interpretation methods make an implicit assumption that they are performed in a reliable and secure environment. However, given their data-driven nature, these DRL interpretation methods themselves are potentially susceptible to malicious manipulations. In spite of the prevalence of malicious attacks, there is no existing work studying the possibility and feasibility of malicious attacks against DRL interpretations. To bridge this gap, in my work, I investigated the vulnerability of DRL interpretation methods. Specifically, I introduced the first study of the adversarial attacks against DRL interpretations, and proposed an optimization framework based on which the optimal adversarial attack strategy can be derived. In addition, I also studied the vulnerability of DRL interpretation methods to the model poisoning attacks, and present an algorithmic framework to rigorously formulate the proposed model poisoning attack. Finally, I conducted both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed malicious attacks against DRL interpretations.

# Min Lee

Currently: PhD Candidate, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University

**Talk Title:**Human-AI Collaborative Decision Making on Rehabilitation Assessment

**Talk Abstract:**Rehabilitation monitoring systems with sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) provide an opportunity to improve current rehabilitation practices by automatically collecting quantitative data on patient’s status. However, the adoption of these systems still remains a challenge. This paper presents an interactive AI-based system that supports collaborative decision making with therapists for rehabilitation assessment. This system automatically identifies salient features of assessment to generate patient-specific analysis for therapists, and tunes with their feedback. In two evaluations with therapists, we found that our system supports therapists significantly higher agreement on assessment (0.71 average F1-score) than a traditional system without analysis (0.66 average F1-score, p < 0.05). In addition, after tuning with therapist’s feedback, our system significantly improves its performance (from 0.8377 to 0.9116 average F1-scores, p < 0.01). This work discusses the potential of a human and AI collaborative system that supports more accurate decision making while learning from each other’s strengths.

**Bio:**Min Lee is a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and machine learning (ML), where he designs, develops, and evaluates human-centered ML systems to address societal problems. His thesis focuses on creating interactive hybrid intelligence systems to improve the practices of stroke rehabilitation (e.g. a decision support system for therapists and a robotic coaching system for post-stroke survivors).

# Monica Rosenberg

Associate Professor, Department of Psychology

Monica Rosenberg joined the faculty of The University of Chicago in 2019. She is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and member of the Committees on Computational Neuroscience and Neurobiology and the Institute for Mind and Biology. Her research explores how we pay attention and how insights from attention research can help improve focus. Dr. Rosenberg completed her PhD and postdoctoral work in the Department of Psychology at Yale University after earning her undergraduate degree in cognitive neuroscience at Brown University.

A primary focus of Dr. Rosenberg’s work has been what we can learn about a person from their unique patterns of brain activity and what this can tell us about the nature of the brain and mind. In particular, she builds models that predict attention and cognition from functional neuroimaging data. This work has revealed, for example, that data collected while a person is simply resting in an MRI scanner (and not completing any task at all) can be used to predict aspects of their behavior, including how well they pay attention and remember information. Dr. Rosenberg’s work also uses behavioral, neuroimaging, and machine learning techniques to investigate how attention fluctuates over time, changes across development, and interacts with the rest of the mind.

# Neil Gaikwad

PhD Candidate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

**Bio:** Neil Gaikwad is a doctoral scholar at MIT, specializing in Human-centered AI and Public Policy for Sustainable Systems. He develops computational and data science lenses to address public policy issues concerning sustainability and international development. This research focuses on the community-based design of data-intensive public interest computing systems to advance equitable public policy interventions for improving the livelihood of historically disadvantaged populations affected by climate change, structural inequalities, and human rights violations. Neil’s scholarship has resulted in publications at AI & HCI conferences, talks at UN and EU global policy forums, environmental art exhibitions, and featured articles in the New York Times, New Scientist, WIRED, Wall Street Journal. He has mentored over 20 students who pursued careers in research and published influential scholarship that has shifted the discourse on AI fairness. His research, teaching, leadership, and commitment to diversity, inclusion and belonging have been recognized with Facebook Ph.D. Fellowship in Computational Social Science, MIT Human Rights & Technology Fellowship, William Asbjornsen Albert Memorial Science & Engineering MIT Fellowship, MIT Graduate Teaching Award, and Karl Taylor Compton Prize (highest student award of MIT). Neil earned a master’s degree from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

**Talk Title:** Community-based designs of Human-centered AI and Public Policy for Global Inclusion, Resilience, and Sustainability

**Talk Abstract:** The field of computational social science has been traditionally focused on analyzing large-scale human and social dynamics in social media. However, millions of people from historically disadvantaged communities, harmed by climate change, structural inequalities, and human rights violations, remain missing from the digital databases, Internet traces, census records, and mainstream policy design processes. While data-intensive algorithms could help improve the livelihood of these at-risk populations, the key challenge is that their prejudiced designs overlook the interconnected nature of colonial, socioeconomic, institutional, and ecological processes that govern our world and amplify algorithmic harms.

In this talk, I will present a data science research program demonstrating how we can bring digitally invisible communities to the center of designing data-intensive public interest computing systems for collaborative public policy decision-making concerning sustainable development. During the talk, I will discuss resilience and adaptation mechanisms required to address climate disasters and agricultural market failures that have led to over 300000 farmer suicides, food systems crises, and forced displacements of women and children in the Global South. Finally, I will showcase how human-AI collaboration system designs, coupled with participatory and remote sensing satellite datasets, can advance equitable policymaking and make socio-technical systems (such as markets and food systems) more resilient to the perils of sustainability.

By studying the interconnected dynamics of socioeconomic and environmental processes and their impact on digitally missing and underserved communities, this scholarship broadens the horizon of computational social science research beyond the Internet ecosystems. It has already led to the informed data science research and policy program in Data-driven Humanitarian Mapping that convenes a global community of stakeholders from industry, academia, NGOs, and governments to tackle overarching sustainability challenges posed by climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Talk Title:**Mathematical Models of Brain Connectivity and Behavior: Network Optimization Perspectives, Deep-Generative Hybrids, and Beyond

**Talk Abstract:**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple impairments and levels of disability that vary widely across the ASD spectrum. Currently, quantifying symptom severity relies almost solely on a trained clinician’s evaluation. Recently, neuroimaging studies, for example, using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) have been gaining popularity for studying brain dysfunction. My work aims at linking the symptomatic characterization of ASD with the functional and structural organization of a patient’s brain via machine learning. To set the stage, I will first introduce a joint network optimization to predict clinical severity from rs-fMRI data. Our model is couples two terms: a generative matrix factorization and a discriminative regression in a joint optimization. Next, we extend this to a deep-generative hybrid, that jointly models the complementarity between structure (DTI) and functional dynamics (dynamic rs-fMRI connectivity) to extract predictive disease biomarkers. The generative part of our framework is now a structurally-regularized matrix factorization on dynamic rs-fMRI correlation matrices, guided by DTI tractography to learn anatomically informed connectivity profiles. The deep part of our framework is an LSTM-ANN, which models the temporal evolution of the scan to map to behavior. Our main novelty lies in our coupled optimization, which collectively estimates the matrix factors and the neural network weights. We outperform several state-of-the-art baselines to extract multi-modal neural signatures of brain dysfunction. Finally, I will present our current exploration based on graph neural networks and manifold learning to better capture the underlying data geometry.

**Bio:**Niharika is a PhD candidate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Her research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, non-convex optimization, manifold learning and graph signal processing applied to neuroimaging data. She has developed novel machine learning algorithms that predict behavioral deficits in patients with Autism by decoding their brain organization from their functional and structural neuroimaging scans. Prior to joining Hopkins, she obtained a bachelor’s degree (B. Tech with Hons.) in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

**Talk Title:**Exploring and Learning in Sparse Linear MDPs without Computationally Intractable Oracles

**Abstract:**The key assumption underlying linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is that the learner has access to a known feature map from state-action pairs to d-dimensional vectors, and that the rewards and transitions are linear functions in this representation. But where do these features come from? In the absence of expert domain knowledge, a tempting strategy is to use the “kitchen sink” approach and hope that the true features are included in a much larger set of potential features. In this work we revisit linear MDPs from the perspective of feature selection. In a k-sparse linear MDP, there is an unknown subset of size k containing all the relevant features, and the goal is to learn a near-optimal policy in only poly(k, log d) interactions with the environment. Our main result is the first polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. In contrast, earlier works either made prohibitively strong assumptions that obviated the need for exploration, or required solving computationally intractable optimization problems.

As a corollary of our main result, we give an algorithm for learning a near-optimal policy in block MDPs whose decoding function is a low-depth decision tree; the algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time and takes a polynomial number of samples. This can be seen as a reinforcement learning analogue of classic results in computational learning theory. Furthermore, it gives a natural model where improving the sample complexity via representation learning is computationally feasible.

**Talk Title:** Efficient data processing pipeline for IoT sensor devices in environmental monitoring networks.

**Talk Abstract:** Low-cost IoT sensors (LCS) have the capacity to provide high resolution spatio-temporal dataset of key variables in environmental monitoring networks. The use of LCS in environmental monitoring, however, continues to raise important questions, especially pertaining to the reliability, field performance and data quality of the sensors. IoT technologies are at the early stage of development in many application areas and as such they are still challenged by a number of issues including data handling and framework. There is currently no universal framework and/or formalized architecture in existence for the application of IoT sensor devices in environmental monitoring and no complete tool has been developed for data handling and analysis.

Developing effective data processing pipeline for IoT sensor data is essential for the adoption and application of LCS in environmental monitoring. In this talk, I will discuss our research efforts aimed at improving field performance and data quality of LCS devices in environmental monitoring networks, through the development of reliable data processing and error correction techniques such as automatic sensor calibration, data fusion, data imputation, outlier detection and effective feature selection.

I will discuss how the capabilities of AI/ML can be leveraged to support the effective application of IoT in ecological sensing. In particular, how these technologies can: 1.) support the operations of LCS in data acquisition models to capture large scale and longitudinal observations, 2.) support the development of specific data handling and Data Quality Improvement (DQI) techniques for LCS, and 3.) serve as effective strategies to support on-site sensor calibration.

**Talk Title:**Power Outage Risk Interconnection: Relationship with Social and Environmental Critical Risk Indicators

[Watch Olukunle’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0relBaBHabw&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=7)

**Talk Abstract:**The interconnections between diverse components in a system can provide profound insights on the health and risk states of the system as a whole. Highly interconnected systems tend to accumulate risks until a large, systemic crisis hits. For example, in the 2007-09 financial crisis, the interconnection of financial institutions heightened near the collapse, suggesting the system could no longer absorb risks. Extending concepts of interconnectedness and systemic risk to coupled human-natural systems, one might expect similar behaviours of risk accumulation and heightened connectivity, leading to potential system failures. The Predictive Risk Investigation System (PRISM) for Multi-layer Dynamic Interconnection Analysis aims to explore the complex interconnectedness and systemic risks in human-natural systems.

Applying the PRISM approach, we could uncover dynamic relationships and trends in climate resilience and preparedness using Energy, Environmental and Social indicators. This study proposes a case-study application of the PRISM approach to the State of Massachusetts using a dataset of over 130000 power outages in the state from 2013-2018. Random Forest, Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMS) are applied to understand the interconnections between Power outages, Population density and Environmental factors (Weather indicators e.g. Wind Speed, Precipitation).

**Bio:**I am a Data Scientist with domain expertise in Energy – Oil, Gas, Renewables and Power Systems. With a BS in Petroleum Engineering and an MS in Sustainable Energy Systems, I have always enjoyed a data-centric approach in solving interdisciplinary problems. In my Bachelor’s degree, I used Neural Networks to solve a practical oil-field (Production Engineering) problem. In my master’s I explored potentials for optimizing clean-energy microgrids in low-income, underserved communities while leveraging insights from large, messy, unstructured data. In my PhD at Tufts I am working in an interdisciplinary team of Data and Domain Scientists where I am applying Data Science/Machine Learning Techniques and Tools to Energy, Climate, Financial, and Ecological systems. One word to describe my experience is diversity. I am fortunate to have enjoyed a fair share of diversity in my academic and professional experience – in geography and in scope. An experience that traverses three continents of the world equipped with a broader scientific and engineering background. This exemplifies my interest in complex, interdisciplinary and multifaceted problems traversing various fields such as: science, engineering and data science. I am enthusiastic about applying my knowledge and skills in Data Science to new, challenging, unfamiliar terrains to discover and garner insights and solve problems that improves experience and affects people, communities, and organizations.

**Bio:** Oscar Leong is a von Karman Instructor in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences department at Caltech, hosted by Venkat Chandrasekaran. He also works with Katie Bouman and the Computational Cameras group. He received his PhD in 2021 in Computational and Applied Mathematics from Rice University under the supervision of Paul Hand, where he was an NSF Graduate Fellow. His research interests lie in the mathematics of data science, optimization, inverse problems, and machine learning. The core focus of his doctoral work was on proving recovery theorems for ill-posed inverse problems using generative models. He is broadly interested in using tools from convex geometry, high-dimensional statistics, and nonlinear optimization to better understand and improve data-driven, decision-making algorithms.

**Talk Title:** The power and limitations of convex regularization

**Talk Abstract:** The incorporation of regularization functionals to promote structure for inverse problems has had a long history in applied mathematics, with a recent surge of interest in the use of both convex and nonconvex functionals. The structure of such functionals largely lies in computational and modeling considerations, but there is a lack of an overarching understanding of the power and limitations of enforcing convexity versus nonconvexity and when one should be used over another for a given data distribution. In this presentation, we propose to tackle this question from a convex geometric perspective and ask the following question: for a given data source, what is the optimal regularizer induced by a convex body? To answer this, a variational optimization problem over the space of convex bodies is proposed to search for the optimal regularizer. We analyze the structure of population risk minimizers by connecting minimization of the population objective to Minkowski’s inequality for convex bodies. These results are also shown to be robust, as we establish convergence of empirical risk minimizers to the population risk minimizer in the limit of infinite data. Based on this characterization of optimal convex regularizers, we then consider whether convexity is the right structure for certain distributions and use our theory to characterize when convex or nonconvex structure should be preferred.

[Watch Pan’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFqhzxrg8Ec&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=14)

**Talk Abstract:**Optimization lies at the heart of modern machine learning and data science research. How to design data-efficient optimization algorithms that have a low sample complexity while enjoying a fast convergence at the same time has remained a challenging but imperative topic in machine learning. My research aims to answer this question from two facets: providing the theoretical analysis and understanding of optimization algorithms; and developing new algorithms with strong empirical performance in a principled way. In this talk, I will introduce our recent work in developing and improving data-efficient optimization algorithms for decision-making (reinforcement learning) problems. In particular, I will introduce the variance reduction technique in optimization and show how it can improve the data efficiency of policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning. I will present the variance reduced policy gradient algorithm, which constructs an unbiased policy gradient estimator for the value function. I will show that it provably reduces the sample complexity of vanilla policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GPOMDP.

Outside of research, he loves teaching and advising, and received the Alan J. Perlis Graduate Student Teaching Award for instructing courses and organizing workshops and tutorials on multimodal machine learning.

**Talk Title:**Foundations of Multisensory Artificial Intelligence

**Abstract:**The study of multisensory intelligence aims to understand the computational principles of multisensory integration and design practical AI systems that can similarly learn from multiple sensory inputs such as text, speech, audio, video, real-world sensors, wearable devices, and medical data. These multisensory AI systems can support human physical, emotional, and social well-being, enable multimedia content processing, and enhance real-world autonomous agents, which hold great promise for impact in many scientific areas with practical benefits.

Multisensory intelligence brings unique challenges to machine learning given the heterogeneity and interactions often found between modalities. In this talk, I will discuss my recent research on the foundations of multisensory intelligence through a new theoretical framework formalizing how modalities interact with each other to give rise to new information for a task. These interactions are the basic building blocks in all multimodal problems, and their quantification enables users to understand their multimodal datasets and design principled approaches to learn these interactions. To further learn temporal interactions from sequential data, I will present cross-modal attention and multimodal transformers which now underpin many of today’s multimodal foundation models. Finally, I will discuss broader real-world applications of scaling up multisensory learning to many modalities and tasks: (1) aiding mental health practitioners in their treatment by predicting daily mood fluctuations in patients using multimodal smartphone data, (2) supporting doctors in cancer prognosis using genomics readings and pathology images, and (3) enabling robust control of physical robots using cameras and touch sensors.

# Pedro Lopes

Assistant Professor, Computer Science

Pedro Lopes is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where he leads the Human Computer Integration lab. Lopes’ research group focuses understanding how to integrate computer interfaces with the human body—creating the interface paradigm that supersedes wearable computing. They created wearable muscle stimulation devices that enable, for example, to: a user to manipulate a tool they never seen before, accelerate our reaction time, read and write information without using a screen, and transform someone’s arm into a plotter so they can solve complex problems with pen and paper. Their work is published at top-tier conferences (ACM CHI, ACM UIST, Cerebral Cortex). Pedro and his students have received one Best Paper award, three Best Talk Awards and two Best Paper nominations. Their work also captured the interest of media, such as MIT Technology Review, NBC, Discovery Channel, NewScientist, Wired and has been shown at Ars Electronica and World Economic Forum.

# Peter Lu

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

In the physics community, there has been a growing interest in using modern machine learning (ML) approaches to tackle difficult problems in experimental data analysis as well as address important open questions in theoretical physics. However, despite the significant advances in ML over the past decade, researchers are still in the process of learning how to use these methods in scientific applications. To solve hard problems in physics and other scientific fields, researchers must improve the interpretability, generalization performance, and data efficiency of ML methods by creating new approaches that are specifically adapted for scientific applications and designed to provide insight into the underlying physical systems. Peter Lu’s research focuses on addressing these issues by (1) creating ML architectures and algorithms that incorporate physical laws and constraints, (2) integrating these physics-informed architectures with existing computational methods, and (3) developing interpretable representation learning methods for discovering meaningful physical features that help us understand and characterize unknown physical systems.

**BIO**:

Peter Y. Lu is an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago working at the intersection of physics and machine learning. He received a Ph.D. in Physics from MIT in 2022, where he was an NDSEG Fellow, and an A.B. in Physics and Mathematics from Harvard in 2016. His research interests include physics-informed machine learning and interpretable representational learning with applications in nonlinear dynamics, condensed matter physics, photonics, fluid dynamics, biophysics, and other areas. Peter Lu aims to develop new computational methods for modeling and understanding physical systems with an emphasis on incorporating physics-informed priors and identifying relevant and interpretable latent representations.

# Phiala Shanahan

Associate Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Prof. Philia Shanahan’s research interests are focussed around theoretical nuclear and particle physics. In particular, she works to understand the structure and interactions of hadrons and nuclei from the fundamental (quark and gluon) degrees of freedom encoded in the Standard Model of particle physics. Shanahan’s recent work has focused in particular on the role of gluons, the force carriers of the strong interactions described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), in hadron and nuclear structure; using analytic tools and high performance supercomputing, she recently achieved the first calculation of the gluon structure of light nuclei, making predictions which will be testable in new experiments proposed at Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and at the planned Electron-Ion Collider. She has also undertaken extensive studies of the role of strange quarks in the proton and light nuclei which sharpen theory predictions for dark matter cross-sections in direct detection experiments. To overcome computational limitations in QCD calculations for hadrons and in particular for nuclei, Prof. Shanahan is pursuing a program to integrate modern machine learning techniques in computational nuclear physics studies.

**Talk Title:** Efficient Neural Question Answering for Heterogeneous Platforms

[Watch Qingqing’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45PgiWIBo3s&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=3)

**Talk Abstract:** Natural language processing (NLP) systems power many real-world applications like Alexa, Siri, or Google and Bing. Deep learning NLP systems are becoming more effective due to increasingly larger models with multiple layers and millions to billions of parameters. It is challenging to deploy these systems because they are compute-intensive, consume much more energy, and cannot run on mobile devices. In this talk, I will present two works on optimizing efficiency in question answering systems and my current research in studying large NLP models’ energy consumption. First, I will introduce DeQA, which provides an on-device question-answering capability to help mobile users find information more efficiently without privacy issues. Deep learning based QA systems are slow and unusable on mobile devices. We design the latency- and memory- optimizations widely applicable for state-of-the-art QA systems to run locally on mobile devices. Second, I will present DeFormer, a simple decomposition-based technique that takes pre-trained Transformer models and modifies them to enable faster inference for QA for both the cloud and mobile. Lastly, I will introduce how we can accurately measure the energy consumption of NLP models using hardware power meters and build reliable energy estimation models by abstracting meaningful features of the NLP workloads and profiling runtime resource usage.

**Bio:** Qingqing Cao is a graduating Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University. His research interests include natural language processing (NLP), mobile computing, and machine learning systems. He has focused on building efficient and practical NLP systems for both edge devices and the cloud, such as on-device question answering (MobiSys 2019), faster Transformer models (ACL 2020), and accurate energy estimation of NLP models. He has two fantastic advisors: Prof. Aruna Balasubramanian and Prof. Niranjan Balasubramanian. He is looking for postdoc openings in academia or research positions in the industry.

# Ramanujan Srinath

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

To understand the neural computations that lead to object understanding and guide flexible, naturalistic behaviors, Ramanujan Srinath deploys AI techniques to inform efficient visual neuroscientific experiments. Using closed-loop neuroscientific experiments (AI generates hypotheses -> experimental data informs AI models) Srinath will test the central hypothesis that learned associations between object-scene properties affect the inference of those properties to guide behaviour.

**BIO**:

Ramanujan Srinath’s research focuses on understanding how the brain processes visual information to guide flexible behavior. Srinath uses electrophysiological, psychophysical, and computational techniques to study how the primate visual system processes objects (presented on a screen) and how inferences about those objects are mapped to behavioural outputs in different environmental, cognitive, and task conditions. During Srinath’s Ph.D. in the labs of Drs. Ed Connor and Kristina Nielsen, Srinath studied how 3D object information is extracted from 2D images using single-unit extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon imaging in monkeys. Srinath brought experience with algorithms to generate parameterised, naturalistic 3D visual stimuli to their postdoc in the lab of Dr. Marlene Cohen. The broad goal of Srinath’s research programme is to understand how the visual brain enables people to interact flexibly with the world by inferring relevant properties of 3D objects in naturalistic environments.

# Rana Hanocka

Assistant Professor, Computer Science

I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). I founded and direct 3DL (*threedle!*), a group of enthusiastic researchers passionate about 3D, machine learning, and visual computing. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2021 from Tel Aviv University under the supervision of [Daniel Cohen-Or](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/) and [Raja Giryes](http://web.eng.tau.ac.il/~raja).

My research is focused on building artificial intelligence for 3D data, spanning the fields of computer graphics, machine learning, and computer vision. Deep learning, the most popular form of artificial intelligence, has unlocked remarkable success on structured data (such as text, images, and video), and I am interested in harnessing the potential of these techniques to enable effective operation on unstructured 3D geometric data.

We have developed a [convolutional neural network designed specifically for meshes](https://ranahanocka.github.io/MeshCNN/), and also explored how to learn from the internal data within a single shape (for [surface reconstruction](https://ranahanocka.github.io/point2mesh/), [geometric texture synthesis](https://ranahanocka.github.io/geometric-textures/), and [point cloud consolidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06471)) – and I am interested in broader applications related to these areas. Additional research directions that I am aiming to explore include: intertwining human and machine-based creativity to advance our capabilities in 3D shape modeling and animation; learning with less supervision, for example to extract patterns and relationships from large shape collections; and making 3D neural networks more “interpretable/explainable”.

# Rishabh Dudeja

Postdoctoral Researcher, Harvard University

**Bio:**I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University. My research interests lie at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics and applied probability. Currently, I am excited about understanding phase transitions, universality, and computational-statistical gaps in high-dimensional inference problems. Before joining Harvard, I obtained a Ph.D. in Statistics from Columbia University and a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.

**Talk Title:**High-Dimensional Asymptotics for Phase Retrieval with Structured Sensing Matrices.

**Talk Abstract:**Phase Retrieval is the problem of recovering an unknown complex-valued signal vector from the magnitudes of several linear measurements. This problem arises in applications like X-ray crystallography, where it is infeasible to acquire the phase of the measurements. In this talk, I will describe some results regarding the analysis of this problem in the high-dimensional asymptotic regime where the number of measurements and the signal dimension diverge proportionally so that their ratio remains fixed. The measurement mechanism in phase retrieval is specified by a sensing matrix. A limitation of existing high-dimensional analysis of this problem is that they model this matrix as a random matrix with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian entries. In practice, this matrix is highly structured with limited randomness. I will describe a correction to the i.i.d. sensing model, known as the sub-sampled Haar sensing model, which faithfully captures a crucial orthogonality property of realistic sensing matrices. For the Haar sensing model, I will present a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of commonly used spectral estimators for solving the phase retrieval problem. This characterization can be leveraged to tune certain parameters involved in the spectral estimator optimally. The resulting estimator is information-theoretically optimal. Next, I will describe an empirical universality phenomenon: the performance curves derived for the Haar model accurately describe the observed performance curves for realistic sensing matrices. Finally, I will present recent progress towards obtaining a theoretical understanding of this universality phenomenon that causes practical sensing matrices to behave like Haar sensing matrices.

# Ritesh Kumar

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Meeting the surging energy demands calls for the holistic development of batteries with significantly higher energy densities than the contemporary Li-ion batteries. Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) offer up to ten times higher energy densities and therefore represent a promising alternative. However, most electrolytes developed for LMBs have poor compatibility with the lithium metal, which is highly reactive. Despite extensive Edisonian experimental investigations over the past five decades, none of the discovered electrolytes can sustain desirable long cycle lives. Ritesh Kumar’s research efforts involve developing and utilizing forward design (structure to property mapping) interpretable ML frameworks, Bayesian optimization (adaptive design) of targeted properties of electrolytes, and inverse design (property to structure mapping) of electrolytes with desired properties using generative algorithms. These AI/ML approaches will enable exploration of the electrolyte chemical space on an astronomical scale that remain vastly unexplored through traditional scientific methods.

**BIO**:

Ritesh Kumar joined UChicago as a postdoctoral fellow at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering under Prof. Chibueze Amanchukwu in 2022. Kumar received a doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in materials science from Indian Institute of Science, India in 2022, with their dissertation formulating robust strategies for designing efficient materials using quantum chemistry-based methods and ML algorithms. Kumar’s research interests span wide areas of materials informatics aimed at developing novel materials, at the intersection of physics, chemistry, materials science, computational modeling, data science, and cheminformatics. Kumar also hold a M.S. in Chemical Sciences from the Indian Institute of Science (2017) and a B.Sc. in Chemistry (Honors) from the University of Delhi, India (2015).

**Bio:**Roshni Sahoo is a PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by Stefan Wager. She studies data-driven decision making, with a focus on applications in public health and medicine. Her work contributes statistical methodologies for tackling challenges such as biased sample selection, heavy-tailed data, and uncertainty quantification. Her research is supported by a Spectrum Population Health Sciences Pilot Grant, NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, Stanford Data Science Scholar Award, and Stanford Ethics in Society Fellowship. Prior to Stanford, she received BS degrees in computer science and mathematics at MIT.

**Talk Title:**Learning from a Biased Sample

**Abstract:** The empirical risk minimization approach to data-driven decision making assumes that we can learn a decision rule from training data drawn under the same conditions as the ones we want to deploy it in. However, in a number of settings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased, and that some groups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be under- or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this setting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield rules that perform well at deployment. We propose a model of sampling bias called Gamma-biased sampling, where observed covariates can affect the probability of sample selection arbitrarily much but the amount of unexplained variation in the probability of sample selection is bounded by a constant factor. Applying the distributionally robust optimization framework, we propose a method for learning a decision rule that minimizes the worst-case risk incurred under a family of test distributions that can generate the training distribution under Gamma-biased sampling. We apply a result of Rockafellar and Uryasev to show that this problem is equivalent to an augmented convex risk minimization problem. We give statistical guarantees for learning a model that is robust to sampling bias via the method of sieves, and propose a deep learning algorithm whose loss function captures our robust learning target. We empirically validate our proposed method in simulations and a case study on ICU length of stay prediction.

# Rui Ding

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

The electronic and lithium-ion battery (LIB) sectors are pivotal for modern society, yet they pose significant environmental challenges due to carbon emissions and non-recyclable waste. Presently, the centralized synthesis and assembly of most electronic devices and batteries make them susceptible to supply chain disruptions, leading to cost and efficiency fluctuations. A promising alternative is transitioning from silicon-based materials to renewable bio-mass derived from plants. Utilizing natural components like lignin and cellulose, researchers can produce nano-sized graphene and cellulose inks. With advanced 3D inkjet printing, researchers can fabricate diverse electronic devices, from field effect transistors (FET) to LIBs and sensors, in a decentralized manner, significantly reducing carbon footprints.

Drawing from their prior experience in applying machine learning for the efficient prediction and design of electrocatalysts, devices, and components in Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) and Proton-Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers (PEMWEs), Rui Ding recognized the immense potential of integrating experimental data, data science, and theoretical simulation like Density Functional Theory (DFT) for optimal results. This holistic approach has not only enhanced the performance and efficiency of these systems but has also paved the way for innovative solutions in the electronic sector.

These high-value products can also integrate seamlessly into previous stages; for instance, sensors can optimize plant growth conditions, enhancing their utility as material resources. This green approach could redefine the future of electronics. The evolution of this pathway can be accelerated by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). By training ML models on data from each loop stage, researchers can offer precise experimental guidance. The ultimate goal is to establish an open-source, AI/ML-powered platform, the Biodegradable Electronic Manufacturing Data Infrastructure (BEMDI), to democratize the production of eco-friendly, customizable electronic devices. Additionally, the data generated will be integrated into existing material databases and manufacturing platform, facilitating knowledge transfer for future endeavors. Besides, Rui Ding is also interested and experienced in leveraging large language models for scientific data mining. And another research interest of Ding’s is automation experimental systems in laboratory driven by AI backend that would allow autonomous materials and device discovery.

**BIO**:

Rui Ding is a Wendy and Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at Uchicago under professor Junhong Chen’s guidance with his supporting resource from Argonne National Laboratories. Ding received a bachelor degree from Nanjing University in China, and also a Ph.D. from Nanjing University with experience as a full-sponsored visiting exchange student in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. During Ding’s doctorate period, Ding’s research projects mainly focused on exploring the cross-cutting field of machine learning with renewable energy material design and theoretical simulation (First principal simulation and quantum chemistry). Ding is familiar with both nanomaterial experimental synthesis and theoretical simulation, and notably machine learning. Ding has done a series of works that applied artificial intelligence to boost the design of membrane electrode assembly in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) and other works that utilize ML to investigate the system of PEM electrolyzers and CO2RR electrocatalysts for the purpose of renewable energy.

**Talk Title:**Asymptotically Optimal Exact Minibatch Metropolis-Hastings

**Talk Abstract:**Metropolis-Hastings (MH) is one of the most fundamental Bayesian inference algorithms, but it can be intractable on large datasets due to requiring computations over the whole dataset. In this talk, I will discuss minibatch MH methods, which use subsamples to enable scaling. First, I will talk about existing minibatch MH methods, and demonstrate that inexact methods (i.e. they may change the target distribution) can cause arbitrarily large errors in inference. Then, I will introduce a new exact minibatch MH method, TunaMH, which exposes a tunable trade-off between its batch size and its theoretically guaranteed convergence rate. Finally, I will present a lower bound on the batch size that any minibatch MH method must use to retain exactness while guaranteeing fast convergence—the first such bound for minibatch MH—and show TunaMH is asymptotically optimal in terms of the batch size.

**Bio:**Ruqi Zhang is a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at Cornell University, advised by Professor Chris De Sa. Her research interests lie in probabilistic modeling for data science and machine learning. She currently focuses on developing fast and robust inference methods with theoretical guarantees and their applications with modern model architectures, such as deep neural networks, on real-world big data. Her work has been published in top machine learning venues such as NeurIPS, ICLR and AISTATS, and has been recognized through an Oral Award at ICLR and two Spotlight Awards at NeurIPS.

**Talk Title:** Labor advantages drive the greater productivity of faculty at elite universities

**Abstract:**Faculty at prestigious institutions dominate scientific discourse, producing a disproportionate share of all research publications. Environmental prestige can drive such epistemic disparity, but the mechanisms by which it causes increased faculty productivity remain unknown. Here, we combine employment, publication, and federal survey data for 78,802 tenure-track faculty at 262 PhD-granting institutions in the American university system to show through multiple lines of evidence that the greater availability of funded graduate and postdoctoral labor at more prestigious institutions drives the environmental effect of prestige on productivity. In particular, greater environmental prestige leads to larger faculty-led research groups, which drive higher faculty productivity, primarily in disciplines with group collaboration norms. In contrast, productivity does not increase substantially with prestige for faculty publications without group members or for group members themselves. The disproportionate scientific productivity of elite researchers can be largely explained by their substantial labor advantage rather than inherent differences in talent.

**Talk Title:**Towards Global-Scale Biodiversity Monitoring – Scaling Geospatial and Taxonomic Coverage Using Contextual Clues

[Watch Sara’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwYnwEfkzDo&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=1)

**Talk Abstract:**Biodiversity is declining globally at unprecedented rates. We need to monitor species in real time and in greater detail to quickly understand which conservation efforts are most effective and take corrective action. Current ecological monitoring systems generate data far faster than researchers can analyze it, making scaling up impossible without automated data processing. However, ecological data collected in the field presents a number of challenges that current methods, like deep learning, are not designed to tackle. Biodiversity data is correlated in time and space, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to new sensor deployments. Environmental monitoring sensors have limited intelligence, resulting in objects of interest that are often too close/far, blurry, or in clutter. Further, the distribution of species is long-tailed, which results in highly-imbalanced datasets. These challenges are not unique to the natural world, advances in any one of these areas will have far-reaching impact across domains. To address these challenges, we take inspiration from the value of additional contextual information for human experts, and seek to incorporate it within the structure of machine learning systems. Incorporating species distributions and access across data collected within a sensor at inference time can improve generalization to new sensors without additional human data labeling. Going beyond single sensor deployment, there is a large degree of contextual information shared across multiple data streams. Our long-term goal is to develop learning methods that efficiently and adaptively benefit from many different data streams on a global scale.

**Bio:**Sara Beery has always been passionate about the natural world, and she saw a need for technology-based approaches to conservation and sustainability challenges. This led her to pursue a PhD at Caltech, where she is advised by Pietro Perona and funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, a PIMCO Fellowship in Data Science, and an Amazon/Caltech AI4Science Fellowship. Her research focuses on computer vision for global-scale biodiversity monitoring. She works closely with Microsoft AI for Earth and Google Research to translate her work into usable tools, including widely-used models and benchmarks for detection and recognition of animal species in challenging camera trap data at a global scale. She has worked to bridge the interdisciplinary gap between ecology and computer science by hosting the iWild-Cam challenge at the FGVC Workshop at CVPR from 2018-2021, and through founding and managing a highly successful AI for Conservation slack channel which provides a meeting point for experts from each community to discuss new methods and best practices for conservation technology. Sara’s prior experience as a professional ballerina and a nontraditional student has taught her the value of unique and diverse perspectives in the research community. She’s passionate about increasing diversity and inclusion in STEM through mentorship and outreach.

**Talk Title:**Inferring networks and behaviors from novel data for critical decision-making

**Abstract:** In an interconnected and fast-moving world, effective policymaking increasingly relies on understanding complex human networks and dynamic behaviors. Novel, high-frequency data sources, such as cell phones and search engines, introduce new opportunities to capture these networks and behaviors at scale. However, there remain substantial gaps between real-world systems and what is recorded in data, such as incomplete networks, unlabeled data, and unknown causal mechanisms. My research seeks to close these gaps by developing methods in data science and machine learning to infer robust signals about real-world networks and behaviors from novel data sources. Using these methods, I derive behavioral insights and build policy tools for high-stakes societal challenges, from pandemic response to political polarization to supply chain disruptions.

In this talk, I will focus on my research related to pandemic response. Specifically, I will cover two lines of work: (1) inferring fine-grained mobility networks from aggregated location data and modeling the spread of COVID- 19, (2) developing machine learning systems to accurately detect vaccine seeking and discover the concerns of vaccine holdouts from anonymized search logs. The findings from these works informed public health policies for reopening, reducing disparities, and distributing vaccines. More broadly, these works demonstrate the potential for large-scale data and computation to aid policymakers, paving a new way to support critical decision-making across domains.

**Talk Title:**DProvDB: Differentially Private Query Processing with Multi-Analyst Provenance

**Abstract:**Recent years have witnessed the adoption of differential privacy (DP) in practical database systems like PINQ, FLEX, and PrivateSQL. Such systems allow data analysts to query sensitive data while providing a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee. However, the existing design of these systems does not distinguish data analysts of different privilege levels or trust levels. This design can have an unfair apportion of the privacy budget among the data analyst if treating them as a single entity, or waste the privacy budget if considering them as non-colluding parties and answering their queries independently. In this paper, we propose DProvDB, a fine-grained privacy provenance framework for the multi-analyst scenario that tracks the privacy loss to each single data analyst. Under this framework, when given a fixed privacy budget, we build algorithms that maximize the number of queries that could be answered accurately and apportion the privacy budget according to the privilege levels of the data analysts.

# Tal Wagner

Postdoctoral Researcher, Microsoft Research Redmond

**Bio:**I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Machine Learning Foundations group at Microsoft Research Redmond. My research interests are in designing algorithms for massive datasets and large-scale machine learning, especially in the contexts of high-dimensional metric data, fast linear algebra, and learning on data streams. My recent work is focused on harnessing the power of big data and machine learning to guide us toward better algorithm design. I received my PhD from the EECS department at MIT in September 2020, and have spent time as a research intern at Microsoft, Amazon and VMware.

**Talk Title:**On the Role of Data in Algorithm Design

**Talk Abstract:**Recently, there has been a growing interest in harnessing the power of big datasets and modern machine learning for designing new scalable algorithms. This invites us to rethink the role of data in algorithm design: not just the input to pre-defined algorithms, but also a factor that enters the algorithm design process itself, driving it in a strong and possibly automated manner. In this talk, I will describe my work on data-driven and learning-based algorithms for high-dimensional metric spaces and nearest neighbor search. In particular, I will show that data-dependence is necessary for optimal compressed representations of high-dimensional Euclidean distances, and that neural networks can be used to build better data structures for nearest neighbor search.

# Teng Ye

Currently: Assistant Professor, Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota; Previously: PhD Candidate, Information Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

**Talk Title:**Promoting Worker Performance with Human-Centered Data Science

[Watch Teng’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmetpdVsTH4&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=13)

**Talk Abstract:**Addressing real-world problems about human behavior is one of the main approaches where advances in data science techniques and social science theories achieve the greatest social impact. To approach these problems, we propose a human-centered data science framework that synergizes strengths across machine learning, causal inference, field experiment, and social science theories to understand, predict, and intervene in human behavior. In this talk, I will present three empirical studies that promote worker performance with human-centered data science. In the first project, we work with New York City’s Mayor’s Office and deploy explainable machine learning models to predict the risk of tenant harassment in New York City. In the second project, we leverage insights from social identity theory and conduct a large-scale field experiment on DiDi, a leading ride-sharing platform, showing that the intervention of bonus-free team ranking/contest systems can improve driver engagement. Third, to further unpack the effect of team contests on individual DiDi drivers, we bring together causal inference, machine learning, and social science theories to predict individual treatment effects. Insights from this study are directionally actionable to improve team recommender systems and contest design. More promising future directions will be discussed to showcase the effectiveness and flexibility of this framework.

**Bio:**I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with Professor Qiaozhu Mei. My research focuses on human-centered data science, where I couple data science techniques and social science theories to address real-world problems by understanding, predicting, and intervening in human behavior.

Specifically, I synergize strengths across machine learning, causal inference, field experiments, and social science theories to solve practical problems in the areas of data science for social good, the sharing economy, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, social media, and health. For example, we have collaborated with the New York City’s Mayor’s Office and helped to prioritize government outreach to tenants vulnerable to landlord harassment in New York City by deploying machine learning models. In collaboration with Didi Chuxing, a leading ride-sharing platform, we have leveraged field experiments and machine learning models to enhance driver engagement and intervention design. The results of my work have been integrated into the real-world products that involve millions of users and have been published across data mining, social computing, and human-computer interaction venues.

# Thomas Callister

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Thomas Callister works broadly within the realm of gravitational-wave astronomy. Nearly infinitesimal ripples in the fabric of spacetime, gravitational waves are generated by the most cataclysmic events in the Universe, including the explosions of stars and the relativistic collisions of black holes. Callister’s interests lie in the use of gravitational waves as tools with which to explore the binary neutron star and black hole population, probe the astrophysical and cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds, and test the understanding of fundamental physics. Practical gravitational-wave astronomy began only in 2015 with the first successful detection of a binary black hole collision by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. Since then, however, the field has grown exponentially; roughly one hundred gravitational-wave signals have been measured to date, and thousands more are anticipated in the coming years. This expected torrent of data promises to unlock answers to a vast number of astrophysical and cosmological questions, but it will also stress current data analysis methods to their breaking points. Callister’s goal as a Schmidt fellow is to identify, develop, and deploy machine-learning methods that will tame this flood, increasing the efficiency and accuracy with which researchers can analyze gravitational-wave signals and study the properties of their astrophysical progenitors.

**BIO**:

Thomas Callister grew up in Walla Walla, WA, after which Callister received a B.A. in Physics & Astronomy from Carleton College, an M. Phil. in Astronomy from the University of Cambridge, and a Ph.D. in Physics from Caltech. Callister spent three years as a research fellow at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics, after which Callister moved to Chicago.

# Tian Li

PhD Candidate, Carnegie Mellon University

**Bio:** Tian Li is a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University working with Virginia Smith. Her research interests are in distributed optimization, large-scale machine learning, federated learning, and data-intensive systems. Prior to CMU, she received her undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Economics from Peking University. She was a research intern at Google Research in 2022. She received the Best Paper Award at ICLR Workshop on Security and Safety in Machine Learning Systems (2021), was selected as Rising Stars in Machine Learning (2021), and was invited to participate in EECS Rising Stars Workshop (2022).

**Talk Title:** Scalable and Trustworthy Learning in Heterogeneous Networks

**Talk Abstract:** Federated learning stands to power next-generation machine learning applications by aggregating a wealth of knowledge from distributed data sources. However, federated networks introduce a number of challenges beyond traditional distributed learning scenarios. In addition to being accurate, federated methods must scale to potentially massive and heterogeneous networks of devices, and must exhibit trustworthy behavior—addressing pragmatic concerns related to issues such as fairness, robustness, and user privacy. In this talk, I talk about how heterogeneity lies at the center of the constraints of federated learning—not only affecting the accuracy of the models, but also competing with other critical metrics such as fairness, robustness, and privacy. To address these metrics, I talk about new, scalable federated learning objectives and algorithms that rigorously account for and address sources of heterogeneity. Although our work is grounded by the application of federated learning, I show that many of the techniques and fundamental tradeoffs extend well beyond this use-case.

# Tyler Skluzacek

Currently: Research Scientist, Oak Ridge National Lab; Previously: PhD Candidate, University of Chicago

**Bio:**Tyler is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, advised by Kyle Chard and Ian Foster. His research interests lie at the intersection of data management, data science, and HPC, focusing on enabling scientists to maximize the utility of massive amounts of data. His work has culminated in the design of the open-source system Xtract that can intelligently formulate metadata extraction workflows for data stored in heterogeneous file formats across leadership-scale computing facilities. Before joining the University of Chicago, he received his B.A. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Macalester College.

**Talk Title:**Enabling Data Utility Across the Sciences

**Talk Abstract:** Scientific data repositories are generally chaotic—files spanning heterogeneous domains, studies, and users are stuffed into an increasingly-unsearchable data swamp without regard for organization, discoverability, or usability. Files that could contribute to scientists’ future research may be spread across storage facilities and submerged beneath petabytes of other files, rendering manual annotation and navigation virtually impossible. To remedy this lack of navigability, scientists require a rich search index of metadata, or data about data, extracted from individual files. In this talk, we will explore automated metadata extraction workflows for converting dark data swamps into navigable data collections, given no prior knowledge regarding each file’s schema or provenance. I enable such extraction from files of vastly different structures by building a robust suite of “extractors” that leverage data scientific methods (e.g., keyword analysis, entity recognition, and file type identification) in order to maximize our body of knowledge about a diversity of files.

In this talk, I outline the construction, optimization, and evaluation of Xtract—a scalable metadata extraction system—that automatically constructs extraction plans for files distributed across remote cyberinfrastructure. I illustrate the scale challenges in processing these data, and outline techniques to maximize extraction throughput, by analyzing Xtract’s performance on three real science data sets.

# Valentin Hofmann

PhD Student, University of Oxford

**Bio:** Valentin is a final-year PhD student at the University of Oxford and a research assistant at LMU Munich. His work broadly focuses on the intersection of NLP, linguistics, and computational social science, with specific interests in tokenization algorithms, socially and temporally aware NLP systems, and computational models of political ideology. The findings of his research have been published at major NLP and machine learning conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ICWSM, and ICML. During his PhD, Valentin also spent time as a research intern in DeepMind’s Language Team and as a visiting scholar in Stanford’s NLP Group.

**Talk Title:** Modeling Ideological Language with Graph Neural Networks and Structured Sparsity

**Talk Abstract:** The increasing polarization of online political discourse calls for computational tools that automatically detect and monitor ideological divides in social media. While many methods to track ideological polarization have been proposed, most of them rely on knowing in advance the political orientation of text, a requirement seldom met in practice. In this talk, I will discuss research recently published at NAACL and ICML that fully dispenses with the need for labeled data and instead leverages the ubiquitous network structure of online discussion forums, specifically Reddit, to detect ideological polarization. I will first give an overview of prior research on polarization in natural language processing, highlighting salience and framing as two key mechanisms by which ideology manifests itself in language. I will then present Slap4slip, a method that combines graph neural networks with structured sparsity learning to determine the polarization of political issues (e.g., abortion) along the dimensions of salience and framing. In the third part of the talk, I will show that polarization is also reflected by the existence of an ideological subspace in contextualized embeddings, which can be found by adding orthogonality regularization to Slap4slip. The ideological subspace encodes abstract evaluative semantics and indicates pronounced changes in the political left-right spectrum during the presidency of Donald Trump.

**Talk Title:**PAPRIKA: Private Online False Discovery Rate Control

[Watch Wanrong’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWPaBShyJ2o&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=15)

**Talk Abstract:**In hypothesis testing, a false discovery occurs when a hypothesis is incorrectly rejected due to noise in the sample. When adaptively testing multiple hypotheses, the probability of a false discovery increases as more tests are performed. Thus the problem of False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is to find a procedure for testing multiple hypotheses that accounts for this effect in determining the set of hypotheses to reject. The goal is to minimize the number (or fraction) of false discoveries, while maintaining a high true positive rate (i.e., correct discoveries).  
In this work, we study False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in multiple hypothesis testing under the constraint of differential privacy for the sample. Unlike previous work in this direction, we focus on the online setting, meaning that a decision about each hypothesis must be made immediately after the test is performed, rather than waiting for the output of all tests as in the offline setting. We provide new private algorithms based on state-of-the-art results in non-private online FDR control. Our algorithms have strong provable guarantees for privacy and statistical performance as measured by FDR and power. We also provide experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in a variety of data environments.

**Bio:**Wanrong Zhang is a PhD candidate at Georgia Tech supervised by Rachel Cummings and Yajun Mei. Her research interests lie primarily in data privacy, with connections to statistics and machine learning. Her research focuses on designing privacy-preserving algorithms for machine learning models and statistical analysis tools, as well as identifying and preventing privacy vulnerabilities in modern collaborative learning. Before joining Georgia Tech, she received her B.S. in Statistics from Peking University.

Currently: Postdoctoral Research Scientist, Columbia University; Previously: PhD Candidate, Washington University in St. Louis

**Bio:**Wei is a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the Washington University in St. Louis, advised by Chien-Ju Ho. His research interests are in online learning, algorithmic economics, optimization, and behavioral experiments, with a focus on developing theoretically rigorous, empirically grounded frameworks to understand and design human-centered algorithms. He received the B.E. degree from Tianjin University in 2017.

**Talk Title:**Learning with Understanding: Human Behavior in Algorithm Design

**Talk Abstract:** Algorithms increasingly pervade every sphere of human life and thus have great potential to reshape various sectors of our modern society. Thus, it is important to understand the role humans play in the design of algorithm. However, human involvement also creates unique challenges. Humans might be careless, strategic, or have behavioral biases.  
In this talk, I will present two works from my own research on theoretically and empirically dealing with these challenges when humans are involved in algorithm design. First, I will describe the problem on learning with human biased behavior. In this problem, the learner cannot directly observe the realized reward of an action but can only observe human biased feedback on the realized reward. I explored two natural human feedback models. Our results show that a small deviation on user behavior model and/or the design of the information structure could significant impact the overall system outcome.  
I then step back and examine whether the standard behavior models capture human behavior in practice by utilizing behavioral experiments. I studied this question in AI-assisted decision-making where AI intelligently abstracts out useful information from a large amount of data. Human then review the information output by the AI and make the decision. I have run behavior experiments to characterize human’s response in practice and established an empirically grounded human behavior model.

# William Denault

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

William Denault’s work is at the intersection of statistics, AI, genetics, and epidemiology. Denault’s research leverages his experiences as an applied statistician in genetic epidemiology to develop interpretable models for analyzing complex molecular datasets. Denault mostly focuses on devising novel approaches to better understand disease etiology, characterizing genetic variants, inferring causal pathways, and elucidating early embryonic development mechanisms. Denault is particularly interested in leveraging information from recent reports on dynamic gene regulation in induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation to study the effect of early-life genetic regulation on later-life adverse outcomes without using an invasive approach. While Denault is a statistician by training, he is interested in empowering the statistical approaches he developed with machine learning. In particular, Denault aspires to develop methods that preserve statistical rigor without compromising the flexibility offered by machine learning approaches.

# Wonjun Lee

Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities

**Bio**: I am a joint NIST-IMA Postdoctoral fellow in Analysis of Machine Learning at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) at the University of Minnesota (UMN). I completed my Ph.D. at the University of California, Los Angeles in mathematics in 2022 under the guidance of Professor Stan Osher. Throughout my Ph.D., I have developed optimal transport-based algorithms to solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Darcy’s law, tumor growth model, and mean field games. As a Postdoc, I will be working with Professor Jeff Calder, Gilad Lerman, and Li Wang at UMN to develop PDE-based algorithms to solve high-dimensional machine learning problems and analyze the theoretical properties of the algorithms.

**Talk Title**: The Back-And-Forth Method For Wasserstein Gradient Flows

**Talk Abstract**: We present a method to efficiently compute Wasserstein gradient flows. Our approach is based on a generalization of the back-and-forth method (BFM) introduced by Jacobs and Leger to solve optimal transport problems. We evolve the gradient flow by solving the dual problem to the JKO scheme. In general, the dual problem is much better behaved than the primal problem. This allows us to efficiently run large scale gradient flows simulations for a large class of internal energies including singular and non-convex energies. Joint work with Matt Jacobs (Purdue University) and Flavien Leger (INRIA Paris).

**Talk Title:**Towards Better Informed Extraction of Events from Documents

[Watch Xinya’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33_HriGigKQ&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=16)

**Talk Abstract:**Large amounts of text are written and published daily on-line. As a result, applications such as reading through the document to automatically extract useful information, and answering user questions have become increasingly needed for people’s efﬁcient absorption of information. In this talk, I will focus on the problem of finding and organizing information about events and introduce my recent research on document-level event extraction. Firstly, I’ll briefly summarize the high-level goal and several key challenges (including modeling context and better leveraging background knowledge), as well as my efforts to tackle them. Then I will focus on the work where we formulate event extraction as a question answering problem — both to access relevant knowledge encoded in large models and to reduce the cost of human annotation required for training data creation/construction.

**Bio:** Xinya Du is a Ph.D. candidate at the Computer Science Department of Cornell University, advised by Prof. Claire Cardie. He received a bachelor degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. His research is on natural language processing, especially methods that enable learning with fewer annotations for document-level information extraction. His work has been published in leading NLP conferences and has been covered by New Scientist and TechRepublic.

**Talk Title:**Understanding Success and Failure in Science and Technology

**Talk Abstract:**The 21st century society is largely driven by science and innovation, but our quantitative understanding of why, how, and when innovators and innovations succeed or fail remains limited. Despite the long-standing interest in this topic, current science of science research relies on citation and publication records as its major data sources. Yet science functions as a complex system that is much more than published papers, and ignorance of this multidimensional nature precludes a deeper examination of many fundamental elements of innovation lifecycles, from failure to scientific breakthrough, from public funding to broad impact. In this talk, I will touch on a few examples of success and failure across science and technology, hoping to illustrate a way for a better understating of the full innovation lifecycle. By combining various large-scale datasets and interdisciplinary analytical frameworks rooted in data mining, statistical physics, and computational social science, we discover a series of fundamental mechanisms and signals underlying the processes in which (1) individuals and organizations build on previous repeated failures towards ultimate victory or defeat in science, startups and security; (2) scientific elites produce breakthrough discoveries in their scientific careers; and (3) scientific research gets funded and used by the general public. The uncovered patterns in these studies not only unveil regularity and predictability underlying the often-noisy social systems, they also offer a new theoretical and empirical basis that is practically relevant for individual scientists, research institutes, and innovation policymakers.

**Bio:**Yian Yin is a Ph.D. candidate of Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences at Northwestern University, advised by Dashun Wang and Noshir Contractor. He also holds affiliations with Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems and Center for Science of Science and Innovation. Prior to joining Northwestern, he received his bachelor degrees in Statistics and Economics from Peking University in 2016.

Yian studies computational social science, with a particular focus on integrating theoretical insights in innovation studies, computational tools in data science, and modeling frameworks in complex systems to examine various fundamental elements of innovation lifecycles, from dynamics of failure to emergence of scientific breakthrough, from public funding for science to broad uses of science in public domains. His research has been published in multidisciplinary journals including Science, Nature, Nature Human Behaviour, and Nature Reviews Physics, and has been featured in Science, Lancet, Forbes, Washington Post, Scientific American, Harvard Business Review, MIT Technology Review, among other outlets.

# Yihang Wang

Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow

**RESEARCH**:

Yihang Wang’s research seeks to use simulation tools to better understand biological systems. There are several challenges when using molecular simulations to study biological systems. One is how to represent a real system accurately with a model. Another challenge is that many events of interest are rare. That is, even with the most powerful computational resources currently available, it can still take hundreds of years or more to simulate molecular processes. Finally, it is also a challenge to understand the huge datasets generated by molecular simulations. Wang tries to address these issues by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with statistical mechanics. Statistical mechanics provides the theoretical basis for the simulation study of biological systems, while AI has shown great potential in automatically making sense of large, high-dimensional data. Their combination opens up possibilities for overcoming the curse of dimensionality and bridging the gap between theory and applications/simulations. Therefore, Wang hopes to utilize their synergies to make simulation tools applicable to systems with arbitrary complexity and timescale.

**BIO**:

Yihang received his B.S. degree in Physics from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in 2017.  He then started his Ph.D. studies in the Biophysics program at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). Advised by Prof. Pratyush Tiwary, he explored the possibility of combing AI techniques with molecular dynamics simulation to study the interaction mechanisms of (bio)molecules. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Chicago Center for Theoretical Chemistry (CCTCh) before becoming an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow.

# Ying Jin

PhD Candidate, Stanford University

**Bio:**I am a fifth-year PhD student at Department of Statistics, Stanford University, advised by Professors Emmanuel Candès and Dominik Rothenhäusler. Prior to Stanford, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Tsinghua University. My research aims at developing modern statistical methods for trusted inference and decision-making, that are simple, robust, generalizable, and minimal in assumptions. A large proportion of my work develops model-free methods that provide solid guarantees for the use of black-box prediction models in complex scientific discovery and decision-making processes, especially with applications to drug discovery. In addition, I study how to generalize causal inference to new contexts and new decision rules; my work under this theme concerns methodological and empirical foundations for the replicability, robustness, and transportability of causal effects, as well as algorithms and theories for policy learning with offline data from sequential experiments.

**Talk Title:**Model-free selective inference with conformal p-values and its application in drug discovery

**Abstract:**In decision-making or scientific discovery pipelines such as job hiring and drug discovery, before any resource-intensive step, there is often an initial screening step that uses predictions from a machine learning model to shortlist a few candidates from a large pool. We introduce a framework that allows using any prediction model to select candidates whose unobserved outcomes exceed user-specified values, while rigorously controlling the false positives. Given a set of calibration data that are exchangeable with the test sample, we leverage conformal inference ideas to construct p-values that allow us to shortlist candidates with exact false discovery rate (FDR) control. In addition, I will discuss new ideas to further deal with covariate shifts between calibration and test samples, a scenario that occurs in almost all such problems including drug discovery, hiring, causal inference, and healthcare. Our methods are flexible wrappers around any complex model. In practical drug discovery tasks, our methods greatly narrow the set of promising drug candidates to manageable sizes while maintaining rigorous FDR control.

**Talk Title**: Machine Learning for Differential equations: Statistics, Optimization and MultiLevel Learning

**Talk Abstract**: In this talk, we aim to study the statistical limits and optimal algorithms to solve Elliptic PDEs from random samples. In the first part of my talk, I’ll study the statistical and optimization property of learning the Elliptic inverse problem using the Deep Ritz Method (DRM) and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). We provided a minimax lower bound for this problem and discovered that the variance in DRM leads sample complexity being suboptimal. Based on this observation, we proposed a modification of DRM with optimal sample complexity. Then I’ll introduce the optimization property of a class of Sobolev norms as the objective function. Although early stopped gradient descent for all the objective functions is statistically optimal, I observed that using the Sobolev norm can accelerate training. Combining the information from the two papers, we can conclude that DRM is fast for the high dimensional smoothing function due to the low computational cost of each iteration. But for low dimensional rough functions, we should use PINN. In the second part of my talk, I’ll talk about the statistical limit of learning linear operator learning, where both the input and output space are infinite-dimensional. We showed that proper bias and variance trade-offs could lead to optimal learning rates. The optimal learning rate is different from learning finite-dimensional linear operators. We also illustrate how this theory can inspire a multilevel machine learning algorithm. Our theory has wide application in learning differential operators and generative modeling.

**Talk Title:** Selective inference for k-means clustering

**Talk Abstract:** We consider the problem of testing for a difference in means between clusters of observations identified via k-means clustering. In this setting, classical hypothesis tests lead to an inflated Type I error rate. To overcome this problem, we take a selective inference approach. We propose a finite-sample p-value that controls the selective Type I error for a test of the difference in means between a pair of clusters obtained using k-means clustering, and show that it can be efficiently computed. We apply our proposal in simulation, and on hand-written digits data and single-cell RNA-sequencing data.

**Talk Title:** Model Criticism for Long-Form Text Generation

**Talk Abstract:** Language models have demonstrated the ability to generate highly fluent text; however, it remains unclear whether their output retains coherent high-level structure (e.g., story progression). Here, we propose to apply a statistical tool, model criticism in latent space, to evaluate the high-level structure of the generated text. Model criticism compares the distributions between real and generated data in a latent space obtained according to an assumptive generative process. Different generative processes identify specific failure modes of the underlying model. We perform experiments on three representative aspects of high-level discourse—coherence, coreference, and topicality—and find that transformer-based language models are able to capture topical structures but have a harder time maintaining structural coherence or modeling coreference structures.

**Talk Title:**Learning to Assess Disease and Health At Your Home

**Abstract:** The future of healthcare lies in delivering comprehensive medical services to patients in their own homes. As the global population ages and chronic diseases become increasingly prevalent, objective, longitudinal and reliable health assessment at home becomes crucial for early detection and prevention of hospitalization. Advances in machine learning and smart sensors hold immense potential for transforming in-home healthcare. However, enabling these technologies for at-home clinical applications requires addressing several challenges, including discovering effective biomarkers with accessible vitals, learning from real-world sparse and biased health data, and making ML algorithms reliable for deployment across diverse environments and populations.

In this talk, I will present new learning methods with everyday devices for in-home healthcare that address these challenges. I will first describe a simple self-supervised framework for remote human vitals sensing just using daily smartphones. I will then introduce an AI-powered digital biomarker for Parkinson’s disease that detects the disease, estimates its severity, and tracks its progression using nocturnal breathing signals. Furthermore, I will showcase the potential of AI-based in-home assessment for various diseases and human health sensing, enabling remote monitoring of health-related conditions, timely care and enhancing patient outcomes.

Currently: PhD Candidate, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State University

**Talk Title:**Towards Interpretable Machine Learning by Human Knowledge Reasoning

**Talk Abstract:**Given the great success achieved by statistical learning theories for building intelligent systems, there is still a long-standing challenge of artificial intelligence, which is to bridge the gaps between what machines know, what humans think what machines know, and what humans know, about the real world. By doing so, we are expected to ground the prior knowledge of machines to human knowledge first and perform explicit reasoning for various downstream tasks for better interpretable machine learning. 

In this talk, I will briefly present two pieces of my existing work that leverage human expert and commonsense knowledge reasoning to increase the interpretability and transparency of machine learning models in the field of natural language processing. Firstly, I will show how existing cognitive theories on human memory can inspire an interpretable framework for rationalizing the medical relation prediction task based on expert knowledge. Secondly, I will introduce how we can learn better word representations based on commonsense knowledge and reasoning. Our proposed framework learns a commonsense reasoning module guided by a self-supervision task and provides word pair and single word representations distilled from learned reasoning modules. Both the above works are able to offer reasoning paths to justify their decisions and boost the model interpretability that humans can understand with minimal knowledge barriers.

**Bio:**Zhen Wang is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University advised by Prof. Huan Sun. His research centers on natural language processing, data mining, and machine learning with emphasis on information extraction, question answering, graph learning, text understanding, and interpretable machine learning. Particularly, he is interested in improving the trustworthiness and generalizability of data-driven machine learning models by interpretable and robust knowledge representation and reasoning. He has published papers in several top-tier data science conferences, such as KDD, ACL, WSDM as well as journals like Bioinformatics. He conducts interdisciplinary research that connects artificial intelligence with cognitive neuroscience, linguistics, software engineering, and medical informatics, etc.

**Talk Title:** Socially responsible NLP via causal and moral principles

**Abstract:**We are currently navigating through an era marked by numerous social challenges: the COVID pandemic, climate change, as well as escalating concerns on the safety of large language models (LLMs). With all these concerning challenges, I establish my research on socially responsible NLP using causal and moral principles. Specifically, I use causal inference to benchmark existing LLMs’ reasoning ability, analyze the failure modes of LLMs, and interpret the relation between data collection and model learning. Further, I combine interdisciplinary knowledge from moral philosophy to design socially-important moral questions to test LLMs, and propose standards for future models to be more morally safe. In this talk, I will introduce my research on these lines, and put forward an outlook for socially responsible NLP.

**Talk Title**: Derandomized knockoffs: leveraging e-values for false discovery rate control

**Talk Abstract**: Model-X knockoffs is a flexible wrapper method for high-dimensional regression algorithms, which provides guaranteed control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Due to the randomness inherent to the method, different runs of model-X knockoffs on the same dataset often result in different sets of selected variables, which is undesirable in practice. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for derandomizing model-X knockoffs with provable FDR control. The key insight of our proposed method lies in the discovery that the knockoffs procedure is in essence an e-BH procedure. We make use of this connection, and derandomize model-X knockoffs by aggregating the e-values resulting from multiple knockoff realizations. We prove that the derandomized procedure controls the FDR at the desired level, without any additional conditions (in contrast, previously proposed methods for derandomization are not able to guarantee FDR control). The proposed method is evaluated with numerical experiments, where we find that the derandomized procedure achieves comparable power and dramatically decreased selection variability when compared with model-X knockoffs.

**Bio:**I am a Ph.D. student in Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunately advised by Prof. Yiming Yang. I received my M.S. degree in May 2021 and anticipate completing my Ph.D. studies in 2024.

My research focuses on neural-symbolic reasoning, which entails synergistically leveraging the strengths of machine learning systems with symbolic systems such as knowledge graphs and combinatorial optimization solvers. More recently, my research interests have been oriented towards the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), with a special emphasis on improving reliability through scalable oversight (minimal human supervision) such as human-defined principles or factual feedback from real-world interactions.

**Talk Title:**Aligning Large Language and Multimodal Models with Scalable Oversight

**Abstract:** There has been an increasing desire to bridge the gap between what we expect AI systems to generate and what they actually produce. At the forefront of this exploration, we introduce novel methodologies for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs): Principle-Driven Self-Alignment (SELF-ALIGN), Self-Alignment with Principle-Following Reward Models (SALT), and Aligning Large Multimodal Models with Factually-Augmented RLHF (Fact-RLHF). Driven by the aspiration to diminish the constraints of exhaustive human supervision and to magnify the reliability of AI outputs, SELF-ALIGN ingeniously harnesses principle-driven reasoning with LLMs’ generative prowess, crafting content that resonates with human values. Building on this motivation, SALT evolves the alignment landscape further by seamlessly integrating minimal human guidance with reinforcement learning from synthetic preferences, offering a tantalizing glimpse into the future of self-aligned AI agents. Shifting our lens to the multimodal realm, where misalignment often translates into AI “hallucinations” that are inconsistent with the multimodal inputs, Fact-RLHF emerges as a general and scalable solution. By merging RLHF’s strength with factual augmentations, this method not only mitigates misalignments but also pioneers in setting robust standards for AI’s vision-language capabilities.

HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE STUDY

# Study Description

Evolution of the study and study overview

During the 2023-2024 school year, the Utah State Board of Education began a data science pilot during which 15 high school teachers throughout the state volunteered to teach a full year data science class for the first time. This pilot presented a valuable opportunity to ask consequential questions about data science education in practice. With funding from the Valhalla Foundation and in close collaboration with the Utah State Board of Education, researchers from Outlier Research & Evaluation at the Data Science Institute at the University of Chicago conducted a study that aimed to contribute to understanding of:

1. four high school data science curricula,
2. teachers’ experiences selecting and using the curricula for the first time,
3. key supports and barriers affecting the implementation of the curricula, and
4. students’ experiences with data science.

## **Participants**

Data science teachers from 12 different public high schools in Utah participated. The high schools resided in the following school districts: Alpine, Davis, Granite, Jordan, Nebo, Provo, and Tooele.

**Teachers Background/Experience:** Twelve of the fifteen data science pilot teachers volunteered to participate in the research. Though all of the teachers were teaching data science for the first time, their overall teaching experience varied, with three teachers reporting less than five years of teaching experience, four teachers reporting between 6 and 10 years of teaching experience, and four teachers reporting more than 10 years of teaching experience. All of the teachers were math teachers and all but one teacher were teaching other math courses in addition to data science during the academic year when the study took place. Two-thirds of the teachers were women and one-third were men. Of the ten teachers who reported their race/ethnicity, one reported being white and Native American/Alaskan Native, and the rest reported being White.

**Curriculum Descriptions**: Using a [component-based research approach](https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/vs3qw), researchers reviewed four curricula (Bootstrap, Coursekata, Introductory Data Science (IDS) and youcubed) and documented in detail their structural and instructional components. Outlier reviewed the instructional materials, the developers’ websites, and observed professional development. Working with the developers’ input, Outlier summarized that information into the information on this website.

## **Data Collection**

To reach the study goals, Outlier engaged with data science teachers and students throughout the 2023-2024 school year.

**Data Science Teacher Interviews and Focus Groups:** All participating teachers were interviewed once a quarter for a total of four interviews each. During the interviews, teachers were asked why they chose to teach data science, their curriculum selection process, their experiences teaching data science, their students’ engagement during class, and the supports and barriers they experienced related to teaching data science. Additionally, near the end of the school year, teachers who taught the same curriculum were convened in focus groups to discuss their experiences.

**Classroom Observations and Student Focus Groups:** Outlier visited a subset of data science classrooms during the second and fourth quarters of the academic year. During the visit, they observed data science classrooms and conducted focus groups with students to hear about their experiences in the class and their reasons for enrolling.

HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE Study

# Data Science in Utah

In spring  2022, Lindsey Henderson, the secondary math specialist for the Utah State Board of Education, decided to bring data science to Utah high schools and forged a path with surprising supports and expected challenges. Four months later, in October of 2022, Ms. Henderson started convening a group of teachers and administrators who were interested in learning more about data science. The following year, at the start of the 2023-2024 school year, the first cohort of Utah high school Data Science Pilot math teachers taught a high school data science course for the first time.

“My personal belief after 18 years in education before I took this job, was that math has a PR problem. I kept hearing the noise and the rumblings in Utah about this data science and what potential data science held…[as a] modernized version of statistics with technology tools. To me, that sounded really interesting. So when I took my position at the State Board of Education…I was like..‘what would it take to start a pilot like this, to start getting this into classrooms and getting students involved in it?’”

> “What would it take to start a pilot like this, to start getting this into classrooms and getting students involved in it?”

!At the outset, Ms. Henderson quickly gained support from local tech leaders in “[Silicon Slopes](https://newsroom.siliconslopes.com/about/),” who explained that  professionals trained in data science were in high demand, and most importantly, from teachers who wanted to teach applicable real-world math. She then worked to get data science approved as an “opt-out course” to traditional Secondary Math III, which enabled students to receive credit towards graduation requirements. She also eventually worked with Utah higher education math administrators to get a temporary agreement in place that would allow introductory data science to serve as a prerequisite course for a college-level dual-enrollment statistics class.

After identifying four seemingly-appropriate data science math curricula, Lindsey Henderson put in a request for funding to begin teacher training. “I asked for like $200,000…I got $20,000. I usually tell people it’s $5…It gave me a starting point.”

The next step was to recruit teachers to actually teach the course. Ms. Henderson used every opportunity she had to spread the word about the pilot. “At every presentation that I gave or every keynote that I gave or every newsletter that I sent out, I would have something that was data science related and I’d share, remember we have this opportunity. It’s a two-year program. You can come learn get trained and then you implement this alternative to secondary math 3 in your classroom or an elective fourth-year math course for your for your school.’”

The interest level was high. At one point, there were as many as sixty teachers and administrators expressing a desire to bring data science to their school or district. For a range of reasons such as other commitments or lack of community support, as the school year approached, the numbers decreased, and ultimately 15 teachers from seven school districts enrolled students in data science courses. The smaller number made it possible to fund every teacher’s curriculum-provided professional development training with the $20,000 allotted.

> “[From] just me at the State Board of Education saying ‘this is a priority,’ I was surprised at how many people came out to support it…”

The participating teachers were not the only people showing interest and support for high school data science education. “[From] just me at the State Board of Education saying ‘this is a priority,’ I was surprised at how many people came out to support it. I really was, and some of the interviews I’ve done with the press, I have never had any public pushback other than, yes, math needs a change. This is a great thing for our students. Nobody in any part of the process came out publicly against it, and that was really actually surprising to me. Everybody seemed really on board.”

“Everybody was really excited. Like teachers were excited to teach something where kids weren’t rolling their eyes and not coming to class anymore. Administrators were excited to have a rigorous 3rd or 4th year mathematics option for students because they want kids to get their diplomas, they don’t want kids to be held back by not earning their diploma–same with counselors…parents were like data science, YES, that’s a great course. There are still some parents that want their students to take calculus–and we have that path, we’re really proud of that. It turns out to only reach about 8% of kids in the state of Utah. So, the other 92% of kids also need a rigorous opportunity for mathematics that isn’t calculus.”

> “It turns out [calculus] only reach[es] about 8% of kids in the state of Utah. So, the other 92% of kids also need a rigorous opportunity for mathematics…”

Simultaneously, other initiatives were taking place in Utah that would help grow data science education. In September 2023, educators, tech leaders, and organizations hosted a [summit](#youtube) to raise awareness on the importance of k-12 data science education in Utah. The Utah legislature was listening and eventually earmarked several million dollars of funding to go towards computer science education, some of which will ultimately be allocated to data science education. This funding should enable more teachers to be trained to teach data science, and Ms. Henderson believes this can spread beyond math teachers. “I think computer science teachers should be able to teach this data science class with a little bit more math training and then I think the math teachers should be able to teach it with a little bit more computer science training.”

Additionally, Utah’s integrated standards and [math pathways](https://www.schools.utah.gov/curr/mathematics/_mathematics_/_core/CoreStandardsGraduationPathways.pdf) are being revisited and revised. “There was a lot of public comment about [how] this [traditional] math isn’t useful in high school. And it was from parents, students, and teachers.” Many were ready to welcome a change in the standards and “felt like data science could help them accomplish that.” Current stakeholders hope to integrate more statistics into the math standards and are discussing offering two third-year high school math course options, one that focuses more on advanced algebra, which will prepare students for calculus, and one that focuses on data science, statistics, and mathematical modeling, and will prepare students for college-level statistics. These potential policy-level changes would likely make data science much more prevalent and universal in Utah high schools.

Lindsey Henderson hopes to see real progress made in math education, but recognizes there are risks and challenges in any change. “​​This giant system that we have still needs to evolve. And it seems like the pathway to mathematical excellence hasn’t changed since 1896, when the Committee of 10 report came out about taking algebra, geometry, algebra II. Trying to …[do]something innovative … is messy work and it’s hard and it’s scary.”

> “The data science pilot teachers are the innovators in the state of Utah and they refill my emotional cup every time I get to work with them.”

Despite all of the challenges and effort that has gone into the Data Science Pilot, it continues to be a highlight of Ms. Henderson’s job. “The data science pilot teachers are the innovators in the state of Utah and they refill my emotional cup every time I get to work with them. Because all I’m doing is empowering them and giving them the safety net of the State Board of Education to do what they are doing in their classrooms which is to bring really important mathematical experiences to kids. And that…that makes me feel amazing.”

The Utah Data Science Pilot will begin its second year at the start of the 2024-2025 school year. Approximately eight new teachers have signed on to teach data science. Additionally, the majority of the first cohort teachers plan to teach data science again, and many anticipate higher student enrollment next year.

Discovery Grant

# A Data-Driven Trigger System for the Large Hadron Collider

Yuxin Chen, and David Miller

Automate the "trigger system" of the Large Hadron Collider by applying recent advances in artificial intelligence to the energy and intensity frontiers of particle physics.

Data-intensive discovery science is increasingly reliant on real-time processing capabilities and machine learning workflows in order to filter and analyze the extreme volumes of data being collected. For example, the search for dark matter at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can produce more than 100 terabytes of heterogeneous, high-dimensional data each second. To filter this data, physicists use “trigger algorithms,” the creation of which is resource-intensive and prone to significant blindspots.

This project will seek to investigate the possibility of automating the trigger system of the LHC, applying recent advances in artificial intelligence, including explainable AI, active learning and imitation learning, to the energy and intensity frontiers of particle physics. The goal is to build a principled, white-box trigger system that could be succinctly explained using existing physics insights, while still having an explicit representation of uncertainty that allows for efficient exploration of the vast space of possible event data. The work will lead to new machine learning paradigms as well as novel insights in discovery science.

# A Data Processing Pipeline for Police Communications

Margaret Beale Spencer, and Karen Livescu

Build a pipeline for automatically transcribing law enforcement radio communications, creating a new data source for the study of adverse police outcomes.

The procedural language law enforcement officers use to communicate with each other can help us understand the institutional, individual, and contextual factors driving the outcomes of policing incidents. Using a public archive of law enforcement radio communications in the City of Chicago (~45,000 hours of observation), the project will develop a data processing pipeline capable of transforming these broadcast communications into transcripts of discrete policing incidents. This novel data source will allow researchers to test the linguistic antecedents to adverse outcomes, such as uses of force, involving minority male youth.

# Mobile Decision-Making for Doctors Without Internet

Andrey Rzhetsky, and Pedro Lopes

Create a mobile Android app for physicians working in areas with poor internet coverage, enabling data-driven medical diagnosis and medical record access in the field.

A large sector of the medical profession in Nigeria lacks traditional decision making systems because of inadequate internet infrastructure, and the country has no electronic medical records. This project will build a mobile system running on conventional Android devices that allows doctors in this region to access basic medical records and perform queries (such as “side effects of diazepam”) over encrypted text messages, as well as access real-time information on the spread of diseases such as contagious infections.

Principal Investigators: Andrey Rzhetsky (Edna K. Papazian Professor of Medicine), Pedro Lopes (Associate Professor, Computer Science)

# Advancing Molecular Measurement with Machine Learning

Eric Jonas

Developing new machine learning techniques to improve spectroscopy and discover new molecules present in your body, your microbiome, and the environment.

Most molecules are far too small to see using microscopes, so scientists and engineers deduce their structure by making spectroscopic measurements: seeing how the molecules interact with light and radiation. Scientists and engineers use spectroscopy to uncover some of the universe’s biggest mysteries and solve some of the world’s most pressing problems. This technique can be used to determine the chemical makeup of cosmic objects, diagnose and develop treatments for diseases, and lead to the discovery of new materials with desirable properties. However, interpreting these spectroscopic measurements is incredibly challenging, often requiring a trained spectroscopist and considerable time. This means we are potentially not observing the billions upon billions of unknown small molecules that could help foster scientific breakthroughs.

[Eric Jonas](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/eric-jonas/), an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, is developing new machine learning techniques to solve this challenge. By treating spectroscopy as an inverse problem – similar to MRI and seismography – he is building self-driving spectrometers which can automatically understand what they are measuring. His methods have been successfully applied to spectroscopic techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Jonas is using his approach to discover new molecules present in your body, your microbiome, and the environment.

Social factors influence health and disease. How can we use them in data-driven medicine?

Beyond the biological mechanisms of disease, social, environmental, behavioral, and psychological factors play a critical role in human health. These factors – that we collectively call the “sociome” – interact with human biology to cause or exacerbate disease and injuries and may disrupt wellness. But in contrast to genomic and clinical data, sociome factors have not been comprehensively collected, codified and quantified for the large-scale data mining and analysis techniques transforming modern healthcare.

This collaboration will build the scalable and extensible infrastructure and architecture that will ultimately assemble, quantify, and organize the entirety of social context experienced by every individual. Once catalogued, researchers can link this information to biologic and clinical data at individual and population scale to understand, predict, and treat health and health-related outcomes. A paradigm project will use this approach to build predictive models for children with asthma on the South Side of Chicago, hopefully leading to better immediate and long-term interventions to minimize disease severity.

# AI-Assisted Molecular Engineering to Detect and Remove Water Contaminants

Junhong Chen, Stuart Rowan, Andrew Ferguson, Sang Soo Lee, Chris Benmore, Seth Darling, Rebecca Willett, and Eric Jonas

How can we better detect and remove dangerous contaminants from water?

!Manufacturers use chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) for a wide range of consumer and industrial products, such as stain-resistant carpeting, non-stick cookware, and takeout packaging. These man-made chemicals have strong resistance to grease, oil, water, and heat. Since PFAS do not breakdown easily, they build up in the environment – soil, water, and the air – and in our bodies. Exposure to these chemicals can lead to adverse health effects including low infant birth weight, cancer, and thyroid hormone disruption.

Currently, detection of PFAS requires the use of bulky and expensive equipment, skilled personnel, and tedious sample preparation and data collection. A team of researchers including Profs. Junhong Chen, Andrew Ferguson, Eric Jonas, Stuart Rowan, and Rebecca Willett at the University of Chicago and Drs. Chris Benmore, Seth Darling, and Sang Soo Lee from Argonne National Laboratory aim to make detection and removal of these chemicals from one of the biggest sources of contamination – water – fast, accurate, and more affordable.

The team will use artificial intelligence (AI) to sift through thousands of molecules to identify target PFAS molecules and use these computational screens to guide the design and synthesis of new molecules that can remove them. The newly developed molecules will be tested using infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and x-ray scattering. This combination of AI-guided molecular modeling, organic synthesis, and advanced characterization techniques will ultimately lead to new devices for real-time sensing of PFAS and advanced sorbents to remove them.

# AI-Driven Tutorials for Radiology Student Training

Chenhao Tan, Yuxin Chen, Aytekin Oto, Maryellen Giger, and Aritrick Chatterjee

Can the success of AI for radiology diagnosis help train tomorrow’s radiologists?

Computer-aided diagnosis of radiological images such as MRIs and X-rays was one of the first successful applications of AI to medicine. In this “human-in-the-loop” paradigm, computer vision models trained on large datasets of medical images detect potential signals of disease and make diagnoses, which are then manually checked by radiologists. This collaboration seeks to extend that loop by using computer models to help train future radiologists, via AI-driven tutorials that explain the patterns and predictions these algorithms have drawn from big data.

Using prostate MRIs as its initial focus, the researchers will develop an “AI teacher” that provides imaging examples alongside explanations of AI predictions. These tutorials will allow students to learn new AI-derived insights about image features to make diagnoses themselves, while familiarizing them with working in tandem with AI assistance. If successful, the tutorial concept could be transferable to training environments in pathology and other medical fields, as well as disciplines such as law and scientific research.

# About the AI and Science Initiative

A new paradigm of transformational AI-enabled scientific discovery across the physical and biological sciences, advancing core AI principles and training a new generation of diverse interdisciplinary scientists.

## Overview

**Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) will fundamentally change the nature and pace of scientific discovery.**

Widespread adoption of AI in the sciences has the potential to integrate scientific inquiry with modes of hypothesis generation, data analysis, simulation, and testing that will transform our capacity to address scientific problems that currently appear intractable.

!

## Investments in AI & ML foundations are essential for high-quality, reproducible,AI-enabled scientific research.

**Successfully applying AI to science requires a radical rethinking of how best to pose and answer research questions.** The University of Chicago is ideally suited to accelerate this transformation because of its expertise in training scholars in a mode of inquiry that is **intensely rigorous, theory-driven, systematic, interdisciplinary,** **and intrinsically open to critique**. The UChicago Approach has always been to question fundamental assumptions, frame problems at as deep a level as possible, and develop novel theoretical and methodological foundations that push the boundaries of new disciplines.

The rise of AI in science and engineering presents both a remarkable opportunity and a profound challenge to human-centered modes of inquiry. Beyond training scientists to effectively use existing AI tools, the **UChicago vision of accelerating AI+STEM research includes systematically reimagining the role of AI in the scientific discovery process.**

---

## Research Themes

**AI uncovering new laws of nature:** Given observations of a system, use AI to uncover the governing physical laws. For example, physicists are developing novel tools to learn equations that describe physical forces exerted by and within cells using videos of cells, overturning classical biophysical models. Similar efforts focus on learning the dynamics of bacterial communities so we can better manage resilient ecologies in a changing environment.

**AI guiding scientific measurement:** Use AI to design better experiments, simulations, and sensors. Particle accelerators and sky surveys are just two examples of measurement systems that collect vastly more data than can be preserved. With AI-enabled real-time data analysis, we can rapidly filter data with dramatically higher accuracy. AI methods can also be used to help navigate a broad landscape of possible molecular structures to design efficacious and environmentally sustainable materials (such as batteries) or new proteins.

**Physics-informed machine learning:** Optimally leverage physical models and experimental or observational data. Examples include learning new climate forecasters, using machine learning together with physics-based models to uncover material structure and properties, and performing medical image reconstruction with unprecedented speed and accuracy.

**Scientific discovery advancing AI frontiers:** The AI+Science Initiative will develop new AI theories, methods, and open-source software tools inspired by scientific settings that will be able to simultaneously solve fundamental challenges across many disciplines. Examples include machine learning on graphs, neural networks for studying differential equations, generative models for science, biologically-inspired AI approaches informed by neuroscience, joint representations of data from disparate sources, and calibration and inference methods for quantifying the uncertainty associated with learned models.

# Center for Living Systems

A National Science Foundation Physics Frontier Center

The [Center for Living Systems](https://centerforlivingsystems.uchicago.edu/) (CLS) at the University of Chicago is a National Science Foundation [Physics Frontier Center](https://www.nsf.gov/mps/phy/pfc_program.jsp). CLS researchers study how living systems process cues from their environment to determine and adapt their form and function. This research inherently demands and will establish a new field of physics that focuses on how physical systems can store, retrieve, and process information to control complex behavior. The CLS will develop education and outreach programs to expand physics education, train the next generation of researchers and bring the joy of CLS research to the South Side of Chicago. Our faculty come from 10 departments at the University of Chicago across the physical and biological sciences and a leader in physics education from Northwestern University.

CLS research focuses on research at the frontiers of physics with the living world that explore the nature of how living matter encodes and exploits adaptive responses from molecular to ecological length scales and physiological to evolutionary time scales. This requires the development of physics of adaptation in strongly driven systems.  The research exploits recent capabilities to acquire large and high quality data in diverse biological systems and advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning. These approaches enable new strategies to study the physics of living systems. The [research program](https://centerforlivingsystems.uchicago.edu/research/) is organized around three themes: Origins of Adaptive Mechanisms, Encoding information in morphogenetic systems, and Computation in Complex Networks and Environments.

**Talk Title:** Covariant Neural Networks for Physics Applications

[Watch Alexander’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTWfe_vuSc&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=2)

**Talk Abstract:** Most traditional neural network architectures do not respect any intrinsic structure of the input data, and instead are expect to “learn” it. CNNs are the first widespread example of a symmetry, in this case the translational symmetry of images, being used to advise much more efficient and transparent network architectures. More recently, CNNs were generalized to other non-commutative symmetry groups such as SO(3). However, in physics application one is more likely to encounter input data that belong to linear representations of Lie Groups, as opposed to being functions (or “images”) on a symmetric space of the group.

To deal with such problems, I will present a general feed-forward architecture that takes vectors as inputs, works entirely in the Fourier space of the symmetry group, and is fully covariant. This approach allows one to achieve equal performance with drastically fewer learnable parameters, Moreover, the models become much more physically meaningful and more likely to be interpretable. My application of choice is in particle physics, where the main symmetry is the 6-dimensional Lorentz group. I will demonstrate the success of covariant architectures compared to more conventional approaches.

**Bio:** I am a PhD student at the University of Chicago working on theoretical hydrodynamics problems in relation to the quantum Hall effect. In addition, I am working on developing new group-covariant machine learning tools for physics applications, such as Lorentz-covariant neural networks for particle physics. My background is in mathematical physics, in which I hold a master’s degree from the Saint-Petersburg University in Russia. My interests lie on the intersection of theoretical and mathematical physics and new inter-disciplinary applications of such ideas.

# Schmidt Faculty Fellows

A program that supports faculty at Nigerian universities interested in applying AI methodology to address significant research questions in the natural sciences and engineering.

The [AI in Science Faculty Fellowship](https://aiscience.uchicago.edu/faculty-fellows/), a program of Schmidt Sciences at the University of Chicago, will host junior faculty at Nigerian universities interested in advancing and accelerating the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the natural sciences. Faculty Fellows are offered freedom and independence in pursuing their AI-related research, including the flexibility to change or expand their research focus and work with multiple research groups at the University. In addition, Faculty Fellows receive focused training in AI/ML methods relevant to their research and work collaboratively with their Nigerian and American colleagues on their chosen projects. Upon their return to Nigeria, Faculty Fellows teach students and their colleagues the computational skills they have acquired while at the University of Chicago. This bi-directional exchange program is complemented by the allocation of computational resources at the University of Chicago that are available to Expansion Fellows both during their training and after returning to Nigeria. This program presents a unique opportunity for Faculty Fellows to become the leaders of Africa’s AI in Science movement.

This program is an extension of the Schmidt Postdoctoral Fellowship Program and leverages existing programming. Faculty Fellows participate in training activities, seminars, conferences, workshops, etc. They form a cohort of top scholars across the natural sciences and join an active and growing AI and science community that includes departments across the UChicago campus as well as [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/), [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www.fnal.gov/), the [NSF-Simons National Institute for Theory and Mathematics in Biology](https://www.nitmb.org/), and the [NSF-Simons AI Institute for the Sky](https://skai-institute.github.io/).

David Miller’s research focuses on answering open questions about the fundamental structure of matter. By studying the quarks and gluons -—the particles that comprise everyday protons and neutrons —produced in the energetic collisions of protons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, Miller conducts measurements using the ATLAS Detector that will seek out the existence of never-before-seen particles, and characterize the particles and forces that we know of with greater precision. Miller’s work into the properties and measurements of the experimental signatures of these quarks and gluons –or jets” –is an integral piece of the puzzle used in the recent discovery of the Higgs bosons, searches for new massive particles that decay into boosted top quarks, as well as the hints that the elusive quark-gluon-plasma may have finally been observed in collisions of lead ions.

Besides studying these phenomena, Miller has worked extensively on the construction and operation of the ATLAS detector, including the calorimeter and tracking systems that allow for these detailed measurements. Upgrades to these systems involving colleagues at Argonne National Laboratory, CERN, and elsewhere present an enormous challenge and a significant amount of research over the next several years. Miller is also working with state-of-the art high-speed electronics for quickly deciphering the data collected by the ATLAS detector.

Miller received his PhD from Stanford University in 2011 and his BA in Physics from the University of Chicago in 2005. He was a McCormick Fellow in the Enrico Fermi Institute from 2011-2013.

Climate change, particularly the exacerbation of extreme events, is among the most pressing challenges facing humanity and the scientific community. Effectively addressing climate change requires rapid advances around 1) improving prediction capabilities and understanding of climate physics, 2) developing quantitative models for climate change’s socioeconomic impacts, and 3) creating new climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.

!

The AI for Climate Initiative (AICE) combines the staggering innovations in AI and rapid increase of data availability with fundamental domain knowledge to significantly advance (1)–(3) in a highly synergistic and interdisciplinary fashion. Close collaboration between different disciplines, e.g., climate science, computer science, economics, math, physics, public health, social science, and statistics, is essential to innovate or properly adapt AI methods for developing novel tools, such as physics-informed predictive models, and trustworthy datasets for training or analysis. 

From developing foundation AI climate/weather models to large-language models, AICE aims to synergise and support the UChicago, Argonne National Lab, and Toyota Technological Institute communities and external partners to transform climate research. AICE complements, supports, and closely connects existing initiatives, most notably, the DSI’s [AI+Science Initiative](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/ai-science/) (led by advisory board member Becca Willett), the Climate and Energy Institute, the [Climate Systems Engineering Initiative](https://climateengineering.uchicago.edu/) (CSEi), the [Innovation Commission](https://innovationcommission.uchicago.edu/) and [Development Innovation Lab](https://dil.uchicago.edu/) (led by advisory board member Michael Kremer), and the [Trillion Parameter Consortium](https://tpc.dev/) for AI+Science (Co-led by Co-PI Ian Foster). 

AICE is currently hiring a Research Scientist. [Click here](https://apply.interfolio.com/159359) to learn more and apply today. EOE / Vet / Disability

# Artificially Intelligent Electrochemistry

Chibueze Amanchukwu, and Rajeev Assary

Use AI to find new, efficient ways of “recycling” CO2 into valuable products such as ethanol and ethylene, using clean electricity generated from the sun and wind

Carbon dioxide emissions are a leading contributor to global climate change, but with the right electrocatalyst and electrolyte, it could instead be a new resource for energy sustainability. The team of [Chibueze Amanchukwu](https://pme.uchicago.edu/faculty/chibueze-amanchukwu), an assistant professor at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, and [Rajeev Assary](https://www.anl.gov/profile/rajeev-surendran-assary), a staff scientist at Materials Science Division of Argonne, will use AI to find new, efficient ways of “recycling” CO2 into valuable products such as ethanol and ethylene, using clean electricity generated from the sun and wind. The researchers will use quantum chemistry-informed machine learning to sift through computational and experimental data and find new electrolytes that can improve the conversion process. Experiments will then be performed using these obtained chemical insights. 

*This project was funded by the AI + Science initiative, a program organized by the University of Chicago [Office of Research and National Laboratories](https://researchinnovation.uchicago.edu/) in collaboration with the Center for Data and Computing aimed at increasing interactions among the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.*

# Automated Experimental Design for Cosmic Discovery

Brian Nord, and Yuxin Chen

Use AI to automate the design, optimization and forecasting of cosmic survey experiments.

This project aims to lay the foundations for next-generation cosmic experimental design backed by new artificial intelligence and machine learning methods tailored to cosmology. The collaboration brings together computer scientists and astrophysicists working to understand how data and computation can inform and accelerate cosmic survey design, taking into account previous data, the capabilities of contemporary computational approaches, and insights from the underlying physics.

A distinguishing aspect of the project is its end-to-end focus, going from simulation to real cosmic survey in a closed loop. The work weaves together advances in deep learning, high-dimensional/nonparametric statistics, discrete optimization, and information theory; the developed methodologies will be validated in simulated environments, eventually leading to a new future cosmic experiment which will be evaluated against existing designs by Fermilab.

*This project was funded by the AI + Science initiative, a program organized by the University of Chicago [Office of Research and National Laboratories](https://researchinnovation.uchicago.edu/) in collaboration with the Center for Data and Computing aimed at increasing interactions among the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.*

# Automated Prostate Cancer Detection Using MRI and Deep Learning

Aritrick Chatterjee, Aytekin Oto, and Michael Maire

Apply deep learning methods to cutting-edge medical imaging to improve the diagnostic accuracy of detecting prostate cancer.

There is a critical need for new methods for the screening and diagnosis of prostate cancer. Using conventional MRI, around 15 to 30 percent of clinically-significant cancers are missed, even by expert radiologists. The application of computer-aided detection and artificial intelligence tools to multi-parametric MRI shows promise in aiding radiologists in prostate cancer diagnosis, but low specificity and high false positive rates remain a concern. This project will assess whether the combination of deep learning methods and data from hybrid multi-dimensional MRI (HM-MRI) — a non-invasive technique developed by UChicago radiologists that provides tissue composition measures similar to the gold standard of pathology — can improve the diagnostic accuracy of detecting prostate cancer.

Principal Investigators: Aritrick Chatterjee (Research Associate Professor, Radiology), Aytekin Oto (Professor, Radiology), Michael Maire (Associate Professor, Computer Science)

# Automating Electron Microscopy with AI

Using machine learning to develop a fully automated electron microscopy workflow to greatly increase data acquisition and analysis throughput by automatically acquiring and denoising images and classifying size and shape dispersity.

Electron microscopy (EM) is widely used in materials science to characterize nanostructures. Currently, the collection and analysis of EM data requires a human operator resulting in both low acquisition throughput and the introduction of bias.

Postdoctoral Fellow [Minhal Hasham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minhal-hasham-ph-d-a7a8a745/) (UChicago), along with Professor [Paul Alivisatos](https://chemistry.uchicago.edu/faculty/paul-alivisatos) (UChicago), [Dr. Joeson Wong](https://jamesfranckinstitute.uchicago.edu/people/profile/joeson-wong/) (UChicago), [Dr. Chang Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chang-liu-221061a5/), and Xingzhi Wang are developing a fully automated EM workflow to automate focussing and image acquisition. As-acquired images will be denoised and classified using machine learning algorithms, removing the need for a human operator to manually quantify the data, resulting in orders-of-magnitude increases in data volume and summary statistics.

This high-throughput and bias-free data acquisition protocol promises to both accelerate the discovery process by providing on-the-fly control for in situ/operando experiments and increase data precision by removing any operator-induced bias during data acquisition and analysis.

# Building Cyberinfrastructure for Rare-Event Searches

Developing a dedicated cyberinfrastructure for the application of data-demanding machine learning techniques to rare-event searches, using XENONnT, a dark matter search, as a testbed.

During the past decade, the incorporation of machine learning (ML) techniques, in particular deep learning (DL), has innovated the field of particle physics. Notably, recent advances in image processing have made Convolutional Neural Networks the most common DL applications in particle physics. Despite the success of DL methods in solving complex problems in particle physics, application in astroparticle and rare-event search experiments is still a field where more progress is needed. In addition, most of the ML and DL techniques in particle physics are ad-hoc and tailored.

Associate Professor [Luca Grandi](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/luca-grandi/), PhD student [Lanqing Yuan](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/lanqing-yuan/) and their collaborators are applying data-demanding machine learning techniques to the XENONnT rare event search. XENONnT is a dark matter search, which will serve as a testbed for the cyberinfrastructure being developed. The results of this project will be applied to future machine learning based dark matter searches, significantly benefiting XENON science.

# Complementary AI

Exploring how to train AI models that augment rather than mimic human capacity.

*To get involved in the Complementary AI research community and receive updates about upcoming events and opportunities, please sign up for the [Complementary AI email list](https://lists.uchicago.edu/web/info/complementary-ai).*

The notion of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that computationally mimics human intelligence has dominated the design of computational intelligence, but is tuned to replace humanity rather than augment its capacity. Rather than targeting Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we argue that AI should be designed to complement individual and collective human capacity, avoid humanity’s blind spots, overcome cognitive and cultural limitations, and unleash novel senses, skills, and imagination.

This initiative addresses new and complex questions regarding how to build AI models without targeting but rather expanding human capacity. This research initiative will integrate with social and behavioral sciences to identify and monitor changing human limitations and opportunities. It will also draw on business and economics to measure and model human-AI productivity; legal and policy expertise to propose models by which AI can assist in the regulation of other AI; and tools and insight across the sciences, engineering, arts, and humanities to align AI with human needs and values. These efforts will grow human-AI potential to grapple with the greatest challenges facing humanity together.

My research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture—novelty, ambiguity, topology—of understanding. I am especially interested in innovation—how new ideas and practices emerge—and the role that social and technical institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations) play in collective cognition and discovery. Much of my work has focused on areas of modern science and technology, but I am also interested in other domains of knowledge—news, law, religion, gossip, hunches, machine and historical modes of thinking and knowing. I support the creation of novel observatories for human understanding and action through crowd sourcing, information extraction from text and images, and the use of distributed sensors (e.g., RFID tags, cell phones). I use machine learning, generative modeling, social and semantic network representations to explore knowledge processes, scale up interpretive and field-methods, and create alternatives to current discovery regimes.

My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Air Force office of Science Research, and many philanthropic sources, and has been published in *Nature*, *Science*, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Science*, *American Journal of Sociology*, *American Sociological Review*, *Social Studies of Science*, *Research Policy, Critical Theory,**Administrative Science Quarterly*, and other outlets. My work has been featured in the *Economist*, *Atlantic Monthly*, *Wired*, *NPR*, *BBC*, *El País*, *CNN, Le Monde,*and many other outlets.

At Chicago, I am Director of [Knowledge Lab](http://www.knowledgelab.org/), which has collaborative, granting and employment opportunities, as well as ongoing seminars. I also founded and now direct on the Computational Social Science program at Chicago, and sponsor an associated Computational Social Science workshop. I teach courses in augmented intelligence, the history of modern science, science studies, computational content analysis, and Internet and Society. Before Chicago, I received my doctorate in sociology from Stanford University, served as a research associate in the Negotiation, Organizations, and Markets group at Harvard Business School, started a private high school focused on project-based arts education, and completed a B. A. in Anthropology at Brigham Young University.

# Computer-Assisted Diagnosis of Indeterminate Thyroid Lesions

Xavier Keutgen, Maryellen Giger, Peter Angelos, David Sarne, and Julian Conn Busch

Develop a new computer-assisted diagnosis approach to define imaging features of benign, malignant, and indeterminate thyroid lesions on ultrasound.

Thyroid nodules are very common and 5 to 15 percent of thyroid nodules are cancerous. In order to determine whether a thyroid nodule is benign or malignant, physicians perform a biopsy of the nodule. However, in up to 40 percent of cases, this biopsy is indeterminate, meaning the pathologist cannot differentiate between benign and malignant cells. Patients are then referred for surgical excision of these nodules in order to obtain the correct pathological diagnosis. But 70 percent of patients undergoing thyroid surgery for diagnostic purposes have a benign nodule on final diagnosis, meaning surgery was unnecessary.

This project will develop machine learning software to define imaging features of benign, malignant, and indeterminate thyroid lesions on ultrasound and relate these findings with current molecular testing. This new computer-assisted diagnosis approach aims to accurately differentiate whether an indeterminate thyroid nodule is benign or malignant, thus potentially avoiding unnecessary surgery in thousands of patients every year in the US. It will foster collaborations between diagnostic and therapeutic thyroid specialists and machine learning experts to study one of the important diagnostic challenges in modern medicine.

# Creating Microbiomes That Improve Human and Environmental Health

Seppe Kuehn, and Arjun Raman

Using machine learning and statistical modeling to create thousands of synthetic microbiomes that could help safeguard human health and protect the environment.

Microbiomes, a collection of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, exist everywhere – in water, soil, plants, even our bodies. The right balance of these organisms is essential for maintaining a healthy body and planet, and research has shown that introducing beneficial microbiomes can help improve human and environmental health.

But designing these beneficial microbial communities remains a challenge. Currently, scientists use a bottom-up approach, where microbiomes are broken into parts and synthetic ones are developed by combining microorganisms with desirable traits. Yet bringing together different organisms can result in unpredictable behaviors – the functions the microorganisms were chosen for may not exist when they’re combined.

Two faculty from the University of Chicago, Professors Seppe Kuehn and Arjun Raman, propose a different approach that mimics the evolutionary process. Through a continuous design-test-build-learn cycle, they will create thousands of synthetic microbiomes and test their function. Each new generation of microbiomes will be built using machine learning and statistical modeling to be an improvement on the last. This process continues until the researchers develop a microbial community with a predetermined level of function.

Using this rational design approach could result in the development of synthetic microbiomes that help safeguard human health and protect the environment, such as microbial communities that suppress disease causing pathogens, breakdown plastic waste, or remove harmful nitrites from water.

# Data & Democracy

A collaboration between the DSI and the Center for Effective Government that conducts cross-disciplinary research, convenes key stakeholders, and circulates and amplifies the findings needed to protect democracy in the digital age.

Our democracy is under assault by the deliberate manipulation of facts, the growth of conspiracy theories, mounting public distrust, and an increasing willingness to endorse autocratic beliefs and engage in political violence—often enabled and fueled by digital media and a rapidly-evolving data landscape.

Data & Democracy — a transformational collaboration between the DSI and the [Center for Effective Government](https://effectivegov.uchicago.edu/) — conducts cross-disciplinary research, convenes key stakeholders, and circulates and amplifies the findings needed to protect democracy in the digital age.

The Data & Democracy research initiative is a unique collaboration between computer scientists, statisticians and political scientists to better understand democracy in the digital age. This initiative will investigate critical questions concerning the impact of misinformation on effective government, how online communication translates into offline political behavior, and the implications of the consolidation of online media platforms for free speech. We invite researchers to join this initiative to spearhead new interdisciplinary research projects as part of a growing community of scholars.

# Data Ecology

The goal of data ecology is to study dataflows and design interventions to control how data impacts our world.

Data shapes our cultural, economic, and political lives. But data’s dynamics are complex and at their core is data’s mobility: it can move from one system, agent, or institution to another.  Data’s promise and its puzzles lie in these *dataflows* and the ecology of structures and agents that produce and regulate them. 

Data ecology is not the product of technical systems, or social and financial incentives, or legal structures operating alone.  It is shaped by those interrelated forces acting together and controlling it requires interdisciplinary tools drawn from a range of fields, including data science, law, economics, and the humanities. 

The Data Ecology Research Initiative supports cross-disciplinary research, hosts scholarly convenings, engages public and private thinkers, and develops models of student instruction about data production, data movement, and data regulation.

Bridget Fahey is an Assistant Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School. Her research in constitutional law focuses on the theory and practice of American federalism, especially how our domestic governments interact in unexpected ways and use unorthodox legal tools to structure their joint projects. Her forthcoming co-authored article *Layered Constitutionalism and Structural Interdependency*, 124 Colum. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2024), identifies and theorizes a largely hidden body of federal constitutional rules that shape—in ways expected and unexpected—state structural choices.

Her earlier article *Coordinated Rulemaking and Cooperative Federalism’s Administrative State*, [132 Yale L.J. 1213](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4226284) (2023), argues that cooperative federalism programs have given rise to a distinctive administrative state—with forms of administrative action and legal frameworks that diverge in important respects from ordinary federal and state administrative law. The Article illustrates this point by identifying a distinctive form of legislative rulemaking—“coordinated rulemaking”—which is widely used in cooperative federalism programs, but cannot be assimilated into familiar administrative law frameworks. Her article *Data Federalism*, [135 Harv. L. Rev. 1107](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4172184) (2022), uncovers a vast intergovernmental market in private data exchanged by federal, state, and local governments, and the unusual cross-governmental bureaucracies that govern that market. Both pieces expound on the insight she first developed in *Federalism by Contract*, [129 Yale L.J. 2326](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3640469) (2020), which demonstrated that the federal government and states use contract-like instruments to structure intergovernmental programs and transact in a wide range of governmental powers. Before joining the faculty, her article *Consent Procedures and American Federalism*, [128 Harv. L. Rev. 1561](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2490605) (2015), identified and theorized the federal government’s practice of using cooperative federalism programs to intervene in and reshape state and local governing processes.

Professor Fahey is also interested in the government stewardship of private data. Building on *Data Federalism*, her cross-disciplinary [work](https://neubauercollegium.uchicago.edu/research/government-data-markets-mapping-and-evaluating-problems-in-intergovernmental-data-flows) funded by a grant from the Neubauer Collegium aims to develop a descriptive and conceptual understanding of the legal-technical architectures that shape of how data moves between—and is controlled by—our domestic governments.

Professor Fahey received a BA in Political Science from the University of Chicago and a JD from Yale Law School. Before joining the faculty, she was a litigator at the Washington DC office of WilmerHale, held a fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and was a law clerk on the DC Circuit and on the Supreme Court of the United States for Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Earlier in her career, Professor Fahey worked as a management consultant for the Boston Consulting Group in Chicago and Berlin.

She teaches 1L Contracts and Constitutional Law, co-coordinates the Public Law Workshop, and has taught informal Greenberg Seminars on eclectic topics including Space Law, Order Without Law, Free Speech on Campus, and others.

# Deciphering Cuneiform with Artificial Intelligence

Sanjay Krishnan, Susanne Paulus, Sandra Schloen, and Miller Prosser

Use computer vision to assist researchers by automatically identifying symbols and words in images of cuneiform tablets.

Manually deciphering a cuneiform tablet is a laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone process. This project explores how recent advances in computer vision can assist researchers by automatically identifying symbols and words in images of cuneiform tablets. It will leverage the extensively annotated collections of the Online Cultural and Historical Research Environment (OCHRE) as training data for machine learning vision models that preliminary results suggest are accurate up to 83 percent of the time. This discovery grant will facilitate an important step towards the goal of meaningful automatic transcription and indexing of the extensive worldwide cuneiform tablet collection.

# Developing Artificial Curiosity Algorithms

Creating an AI agent capable of independent, rigorous scientific discovery in a laboratory meta-fluid with complex flows.

In the last decade, experimental advances in the fabrication of meta-fluids out of active and stimuli-responsive components have led to a paradigm shift in how we describe condensed matter systems. By harnessing ambient energy sources, these materials bypass the tight constraints imposed by equilibrium physics. Novel meta-fluids require new paradigms for exploring systems, even without knowing what the interesting quantities to measure are.

Professor [William Irvine](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/william-t.m.-irvine/) aims to address this need by utilizing artificial intelligence to explore and discover new behaviors in dynamical systems without relying on preconceived notions of what an interesting behavior looks like through the use of curiosity driven exploration. Creating an AI agent capable of independent, rigorous scientific discovery in a laboratory meta-fluid with complex flows will open the door to additional scientific investigation, such as for performing optimization for magnetic actuation protocols which generate curiosity-discovered fluid morphologies, or even morphological transitions.

# Discovering the Design Rules Linking Protein Sequence to Function

Using and developing advanced multi-modal generative AI models to map the relationship between protein sequences and their functions, enabling the design of novel proteins with desired properties.

Over the past decade, our ability to read, write, and edit exhaustive amount of DNA comprising complete genomes has flourished, leading to vast amounts of rich biological data available for analysis. However, a significant bottleneck is our capacity to author and design meaningful genes that code for proteins that conduct desirable properties, elevated functions, or novel functions. With the recent breakthroughs in multi-modal models, which have achieved remarkable success in high-resolution text-to-image synthesis, we are now extending this technology to the realm of biophysics and protein engineering, specifically for text-to-protein sequence generation. This innovative approach enables the design of proteins with specified functionalities based on natural language prompts, with subsequent experimental verification conducted in our laboratory to confirm their practical utility and effectiveness.

PhD student [Nikša Praljak](https://biophysics.uchicago.edu/the-students/niksa_praljak/), along with Associate Professor [Andrew Ferguson](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/andrew-ferguson/) and Professor [Rama Ranganathan](https://pme.uchicago.edu/faculty/rama-ranganathan) from the University of Chicago are tackling this challenge by leveraging data-driven models trained on protein sequences. They aim to decode the principles linking protein sequence to function, paving the way for the development of novel synthetic proteins in the lab. Their project is poised to introduce a pioneering platform that marries computational analysis with experimental procedures for the fast-track design of synthetic proteins, tailored to specific functionalities. This innovative platform not only circumvents the need for traditional alignments and introduces fresh sequence diversification strategies but also integrates active learning loops and the use of natural language prompts for guiding the text-to-protein generation process, enhancing the precision and scope of sequence-based protein design.

# Disentangling Visual Style and Content

Jason Salavon, and Greg Shakhnarovich

New style transfer models that separate, capture, and manipulate content and style, unlocking potential for art and science.

How does a young child learn that a plush toy, a crude drawing, and a photograph are all distinct representations of the same content, such as a bear? Embedded in this question is a requirement to disentangle the content of visual input from its form of delivery. These concerns are important to many domains, including computer vision and the creation of visual culture. This project considers the problem of formalizing the concepts of ‘style’ and ‘content’ in images and video. Despite their importance, and our intuitive understanding of these distinctions, there are no compelling and technically useful definitions of these concepts. The researchers will investigate possible ways to define them and operationalize these definitions to improve the state of the art in style transfer and image analysis, as well as produce novel AI-driven visual artifacts.

Existing scholarship offers limited guidance for these decisions as it tends to model sectors of the knowledge economy as modules, rather than parts of a connected, adaptive system. This project will leverage unprecedented access to the complete LinkedIn dataset to identify mixtures of knowledge, skills, and relationships that maximize income and future potential for individual participants in the knowledge economy. Coupled with enterprise and regional data, the researchers will perform natural experiments to evaluate predictions about marginal skill development and optimal skill sourcing to yield a wealth of intellectual, technological, and commercial innovations that will have a direct and positive impact on society.

# Examining The Mystery of How Living Organisms Develop

Margaret Gardel, and Vincenzo Vitelli

A machine learning pipeline that extracts the underlying principles of cell behavior from experimental data, offering new possibilities for the application of bioengineering in clinical diagnosis.

Microscopy techniques have given us a wealth of information about cells, from their molecular components to how multiple cells interact at the tissue level. Yet, we still do not know how molecular inputs determine the fate of a cell or how complex cellular interactions lead to tissue development. Understanding this behavior will unlock the mystery of how living organisms develop.

UChicago Professors [Margaret Gardel](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/margaret-gardel/) and [Vincenzo Vitelli](https://home.uchicago.edu/~vitelli/index.html) have set out to help solve this puzzle by establishing a machine learning pipeline that uses existing experimental data to extract the underlying principles of cell behavior at different scales. At the subcellular scale, they will identify key proteins that affect cell development and how the location of the protein within the cell impacts its function. At the multicellular scale, they will investigate cellular interactions to determine how specific groups of cells behave and how these random interactions affect cell and tissue development.

This study could improve our fundamental understanding of cell systems and offer new possibilities for the application of bioengineering in clinical diagnosis, ultimately providing us with the ability to control the cellular dynamics that lead to diseases ranging from cancer to dementia.

# Exploring Climate and Biodiversity with 3D Deep Learning

Tingran Gao, and David Jablonski

Use deep learning and modern 3D imaging technology to understand the impact of climate change on the diversity of global marine species.

Understanding the impact of climate change on the diversity of global marine species has important economic value for fishery and policy making. Changes in water temperature, nutrients, and ecological associations can affect an organism’s physical form and growth, which are critical to determining where a species can survive. Using modern 3D imaging technology, this project will quantify large-scale variations in bivalve shell morphology and statistically analyze how they respond to global climate change by developing highly efficient end-to-end geometric deep learning systems that can automatically extract latent semantic representations from millions of micro-CT scans.

# Facebook Messenger Chatbot for Surveys and Intervention Testing

Molly Offer-Westort, and Nick Feamster

Developing a chatbot that can be used for researching information consumption and messaging interventions for political participation and behavior.

For many Internet users, Facebook is the portal to the Internet. Understanding how people consume and engage with information on Facebook is central to understanding how information and misinformation spreads on the Internet and shapes perspectives. Chatbots offer a promising new research tool for engaging with users within the context of their regular social media engagement. This project will develop a new Facebook Messenger chatbot that can be used for a variety of research uses: canvassing on a broad range of topics, measuring information consumption, or studying the effect of messaging interventions on political participation and behavior. The researchers will also use adaptive, data-driven algorithms that learn from exchanges with users and determine optimally persuasive messaging around political events.

# Health Monitoring Based on Wearable Sweat Sensors

Pedro Lopes, Sihong Wang, and Alex Mazursky

Engineer a wearable featuring skin-compatible chemical sensors to enable real time continuous sampling of biomarkers from sweat and open new avenues for medicine.

Wearable health monitoring devices can potentially change healthcare through continuous monitoring of people’s physiological conditions. There are a variety of chemical biomarkers in human body fluids that carry vast amounts of information linked to health conditions. For example, sweat contains biomarkers that indicate conditions such as lung infections, depression, and tuberculosis. Unfortunately, the only way that doctors and patients have access to this data today is via lab tests.

We will explore engineering a wearable featuring skin-compatible chemical sensors. Our sweat sensor is based on organic transistors that are engineered to be skin-conformable — an ideal candidate for a wearable device laminated on the user’s skin. This will enable real time continuous sampling of biomarkers from sweat, which could open new avenues for medicine. Furthermore, the analysis of chemical biomarkers, such as the 220 proteins that can be found in sweat, affords a diverse and complex data space. Unlike more straightforward health data, such as traditional heart monitors, the vast amount of data that is captured in a sweat sensor requires a complex analysis, which we will explore by automated machine analysis.

# Improving Prediction of Breast Cancer Patient Response to Therapy

Using high-plex immunofluorescence to develop meaningful and interpretable spatial features of the tumor-immune microenvironment in breast cancer to improve prediction of patient response to therapy.

Breast cancer remains the most common and deadliest cancer for women worldwide. Chemotherapy is an essential component of treatment, and the addition of neoadjuvant immunotherapies have demonstrated improved responses for patients with HER2- BC. However, no robust method exists for predicting which patients will respond to immunotherapy. As immunotherapy toxicities may be permanent and severely impact quality of life, selecting which patients will respond to immunotherapy is of critical importance for patient care.

UChicago postdoctoral fellow [Madeleine S. Torcasso](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/madeleine-torcasso/), along with [Dr. Maryellen L. Giger](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/faculty/maryellen-l-giger-phd) and [Dr. Frederick Howard](https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/faculty/frederick-howard-md), are working to address this issue by utilizing machine learning to enable the discovery of response-predictive spatial immunity features from highly multiplexed fluorescence microscopy, or high-plex IF, images. High-plex IF allows for spatial analysis of the tumor:immune environment and other cellular features of breast cancer. The results of this work will help to better select patients for immunotherapy, improving outcomes and reducing toxicity for breast cancer patients.

# Interconnection Measurement Project

Nick Feamster

Creating a common tool to measure internet traffic across ISPs

Participating Internet Service Providers have installed a common tool to measure traffic at their interconnects, the individual points where ISPs exchange traffic with the greater Internet. This effort includes multiple ISPs, providing direct information on the capacity and utilization of interconnects. All data and visualizations are of ingress capacity and utilization.

Across the approximately 2900 links included in the data set, representing the diverse and broadly substitutable routes available for Internet traffic flows, the Project reveals an approximate 31% use of the capacity during peak periods in June 2021. The data further shows that ISPs are adding capacity to address continued traffic growth. Further segmentation and analysis of the data is available below. The Project will regularly refresh the data and analysis to provide a dynamic picture of how the Internet is evolving.

Data Science Institute and the participating ISPs will annually assess whether the project remains relevant as broadband network technologies and Internet interconnection architectures continue to evolve.

# Internet Equity

Developing new data science tools to measure broadband access and performance and working with community partners to make high-speed internet accessible to all.

[Visit the Internet Equity Initiative Data Portal](http://internetequity.uchicago.edu)

Educational and economic opportunity, as well as health outcomes, depend on the availability of affordable, high-speed Internet access. The COVID-19 pandemic—and in particular society’s increasing reliance on reliable high-speed broadband Internet access during the crisis—has accelerated and magnified these existing disparities. As the essential tasks of living, such as learning, job seeking, and accessing health care, move online, Internet access is increasingly becoming an issue of educational equality and economic opportunity, one that disproportionately hurts low-income families and minorities.

The lack of precise broadband deployment data complicates this issue and attempts to remedy the “digital divide.” Current FCC broadband maps rely on census block data that overestimates the number of households with Internet access and lacks fine-grained detail. With [a grant](/news/mapping-and-mitigating-the-urban-digital-divide/) from [data.org](http://data.org), our team will innovate new, powerful data science approaches that gather and aggregate multiple data sources to produce accurate broadband maps. We will also create an Internet measurement and performance toolkit that will allow policymakers, administrators, and the public to locate and understand the gaps in Internet coverage and target critical resource investments among communities most in need.

Interdisciplinary researchers at the University of Chicago, including the [Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice](https://crownschool.uchicago.edu/) and the [Office of Civic Engagement](https://civicengagement.uchicago.edu/), will work with Chicago Public Schools and civic non-profit organization [Kids First](https://kidsfirstchicago.org/) and urban solutions accelerator [City Tech Collaborative](https://www.citytech.org/) to develop technical tools and data that meet the needs of stakeholders and community members, reducing inequities in high-speed Internet access.

# Is Climate Change Changing Clouds?

Rebecca Willett, Ian Foster, Elisabeth Moyer, and Michael Maire

Use machine learning and computer vision to classify cloud textures and patterns, and how those features have changed over time, in order to improve climate projections.

Clouds play a dominant role in the Earth’s radiation budget, both reflecting sunlight and trapping infrared radiation. Their responses are the primary source of uncertainty in the numerical simulations used to construct projections of future climate. Satellite data provides detailed imagery of clouds — especially their spatial and temporal distribution. A major open question in climate science is whether researchers can automatically extract spatiotemporal features of clouds from satellite imagery to aid in climate analysis.

This project is a joint effort among Argonne, UChicago Atmospheric Sciences, and UChicago Computer Science aimed at leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning tools to extract cloud features from satellite data and characterize the temporal evolution of those patterns in response to a changing climate. This collaborative effort is necessary because off-the-shelf vision tools do not reflect the physical context of cloud formation, necessitating active collaborations between computer science and atmospheric science. Furthermore, the vast quantity of cloud data demands efficient, large-scale, and parallel computing capabilities being developed at Argonne.

Rebecca Willett, Dana Mendelson, Prasanna Balaprakash, Jiali Wang, and Rao Kotamarthi

Explore the mathematical limits of learned emulators for climate, astrophysics, and high-energy physics models and quantify key trade offs related to accuracy and speed

Researchers studying climate, astrophysics, and high-energy physics use large, complex simulations to guide experiments and test theories. These compute-intensive programs can run much faster using emulators that approximate some aspects of those models. Recently, scientists have started creating “learned emulators” using AI neural network approaches, but have not yet fully explored the advantages and potential pitfalls of these surrogates. These aspects will be examined by the team of [Rebecca Willett](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/rebecca-willett/), professor of computer science and statistics at UChicago, [Dana Mendelson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dana-mendelson-05b12414a/), assistant professor of mathematics at UChicago, [Prasanna Balaprakash](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~pbalapra/research.html), computer scientist at Argonne, [Jiali Wang](https://www.anl.gov/profile/jiali-wang), assistant atmospheric scientist in Environmental Science Division at Argonne, and [Rao Kotamarthi](https://www.anl.gov/profile/rao-kotamarthi), department head of atmospheric science and climate and chief scientist for the Environmental Science Division at Argonne. This team will explore the mathematical limits of these methods and quantify key trade offs related to accuracy and speed.

# Learning How To Measure Scientific Images

Gordon Kindlmann, William Irvine, and Zhuokai Zhao

Create a visual, interactive data analysis system that will lower the human cost of creating new ways to study nature.

To reveal and understand physical laws of nature, scientists sometimes create novel experimental systems in their laboratories, which they then capture with video cameras. To fully realize what these systems are showing, however, scientists must also often create new, bespoke computational data analysis pipelines to extract key quantitative parameters from their video image data. This project seeks to discover underlying commonality between different forms of experimental scientific data analyses, and then exploit these shared properties with a combination of machine learning methods (data augmentation and active learning). Ultimately, it seeks to create a visual, interactive data analysis system, based on a neural network for image processing and visualization for display of extracted features, that will lower the human cost of creating new ways to study nature.

# Machine Learning and Satellite Imaging to Reduce Methane Emissions

Thomas R. Covert, Michael Greenstone, and Charlie Sheils

Develop a data-driven approach to methane emissions monitoring and regulation that leverages machine learning and high-resolution emissions measurements from satellites.

The meteoric rise of shale oil and gas drilling in the United States poses significant challenges for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The methane emitted from these operations has 34 times greater short-term global warming potential than CO2, thus contributing aggressively to climate change. Existing methods of measuring methane emissions are imprecise and expensive, severely limiting regulators’ ability to monitor and enforce regulations. Without reliable estimates of methane emissions, regulators are unable to efficiently target leaks, incentivize their prevention, and realize climate benefits.

This project will develop and test a data-driven approach to methane emissions monitoring and regulation, in close partnership with Colorado regulators. It will leverage large-scale administrative data such as permitting records and historical inspections to build a supervised machine learning model that predicts methane leaks at facilities. These predictions can then be used to target the collection of high-resolution emissions measurements at the facility level using state-of-the-art satellites. This breakthrough combination of machine learning and new measurement technology would provide regulators with a potentially highly cost-effective and scalable inspection targeting framework. Finally, a randomized controlled trial will rigorously estimate the impact of applying the novel technology for regulatory enforcement, and estimate the benefits of improved emissions monitoring.

# Machine Learning to Improve Targeted Cancer Therapy

Samantha Riesenfeld, Alexander Pearson, Greg Shakhnarovich, Michael Maire, Thomas Brettin, Yitan Zhu, Robert Grossman, and Nicole Cipriani

Can a combination of AI, genomics, and pathology create more effective personalized cancer treatment?

Advances in genomics have created many new cancer therapies that target specific genetic or molecular features, raising the potential for personalized treatment that improves effectiveness and decreases side effects. However, the majority of patients treated with targeted therapies do not respond as predicted, and detailed patient genomic information is expensive to acquire.

This collaboration proposes to improve targeting of cancer therapies by developing new AI approaches that recommend the best treatment based on a combination of genetic and pathology data. Researchers will build new methods drawing upon computer vision and machine learning to gather essential contextual information about individual cancers from tumor samples, utilizing both genomic and image-based features. This work will advance both artificial intelligence and cancer-focused data science by developing innovative solutions to emerging machine learning problems in cancer research, ultimately benefiting patients through more targeted, effective treatments.

# Measuring Messages About Race and Gender in Children’s Books

Anjali Adukia, Hakizumwami Birali Runesha, and Emileigh Harrison

Understand children’s exposure to race- and gender-coded messages with new methods in human-directed, machine-implemented content analysis.

Early influences that depress children’s beliefs about their own ability can lead to lower educational achievement and persistent disadvantage. In particular, receiving negative messages about gender- and race-specific levels of ability have played a role in generating disadvantage for women and minorities. Children are particularly vulnerable to negative messages about race and gender, as their beliefs about their own capacities are highly malleable.

This project aims to improve how we estimate the extent and implications of children’s exposure to race- and gender-coded messages. The initial goal of the project will be to develop, verify, apply, and disseminate new methods of human-directed, machine-implemented content analysis focused on measuring implicit messages about race and gender in visual content. We anticipate that the tools we develop will catalyze new research in fields such as computational science and social science, and will advance our understanding of the extent of these messages and their contribution to inequality.

# N-body Networks for Jet Physics at the Energy Frontier

Risi Kondor, and David Miller

Build a new kind of neural network architecture that reflects the physical laws governing subatomic particles, isolating meaningful signal from massive data streams and revealing previously unwitnessed particles and forces.

Machine learning methods are becoming essential for high energy physics experiments at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, existing ML algorithms typically do not account for underlying symmetry properties of the physical systems and interactions of interest, and must learn, often imperfectly, the phenomenological implications of any symmetries involved. This project will develop a new approach based on a novel type of covariant neural network architecture called N-body networks, and will develop a Lorentz invariant neural network software library for systems of particles whose properties are invariant under generalized Lorentz transformations.

# Neural Network Algorithms to Decode the Octopus Neural Network

Peter Littlewood, Nicola Ferrier, and Bobby Kasthuri

Scientists will use computational techniques to map the neural network of an octopus, the largest invertebrate brain, and better understand the fundamental principles of neuroscience.

A map of all of the connections in the brain of an advanced animal – together with the means to interpret it – would reveal fundamental principles of organization that would likely revolutionize neuroscience. Using X-ray and electron microscopy imaging at Argonne and UChicago, researchers can now collect the petabyte scale datasets that in principle make this possible.

AI tools will be critical for the analysis. This project will use neural networks to convert three-dimensional raw images into a map — the “connectome” — and make sense of the revealed structure, by building statistical inference of an underlying physical model. These approaches will be applied to the nervous system of the octopus to understand the complex neural network that exists in octopus arms, including chemotactic sensing, camouflage, and motor response. The collaboration brings together animal expertise and husbandry from UChicago and the [Marine Biological Laboratory](https://www.mbl.edu/), large-scale instrumentation and imaging from the [Advanced Photon Source](https://www.aps.anl.gov/) at Argonne, and high performance computing and mathematics from Argonne.

*This project was funded by the AI + Science initiative, a program organized by the University of Chicago [Office of Research and National Laboratories](https://researchinnovation.uchicago.edu/) in collaboration with the Center for Data and Computing aimed at increasing interactions among the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.*

# On-Chip Machine Learning for intelligent Pixel Detectors

Developing next generation microelectronics with on-chip machine learning for future intelligent pixel detectors.

Detectors at future high energy colliders will face enormous technical challenges. Disentangling the unprecedented numbers of particles expected in each event will require highly granular silicon pixel detectors with billions of readout channels. With event rates as high as 40 MHz, these detectors will generate petabytes of data per second. To enable discovery within strict bandwidth and latency constraints, future trackers must be capable of fast, power efficient, and radiation hard data-reduction at the source.

UChicago Schmidt Fellow [Anthony Badea](https://efi.uchicago.edu/people/profile/anthony-badea/) and Assistant Professor [Karri DiPetrillo](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/karri-dipetrillo/), along with collaborators from Fermilab and nearby universities, are designing a Neural Network (NN) that can be implemented in a radiation hard readout integrated circuit (ROIC). This technology has many applications besides intelligent pixel detectors, with the potential to enable breakthroughs in many areas of science and industry.

# Outlier Research & Evaluation

Outlier Research & Evaluation is a team focused on bringing equity to education, with a focus on learners of all ages from groups historically underrepresented in STEM. Outlier has worked across boundaries of academic, public school, museum, industry and policy settings on numerous STEM education areas ranging from state-level STEM school policy to elementary school computer science. Outlier has a particular focus on understanding implementation, spread and endurance of educational innovations. In this work, Outlier uses implementation frameworks and component-based research approaches to generate knowledge about the parts of an innovation that work for whom, under what conditions and for how long. Outlier prioritizes applied research and evaluation conducted in partnership with practitioners and others who complement Outlier’s expertise with their own.

**Talk Title:** Targeting humanitarian aid with machine learning and digital data

**Abstract:**The vast majority of humanitarian aid and social protection programs globally are targeted, providing assistance to individuals or communities identified to be poorest or most in need. In low and middle-income countries, the targeting of aid programs is often limited by low-quality, out-of-date, or missing data on poverty and vulnerability. Novel “big” digital data sources, such as those captured by satellites, mobile phones, and financial services providers — when combined with advances in machine learning — can improve the accuracy of aid program targeting. In this talk, I will cover empirical results on the accuracy of these new data-driven and algorithmic approaches to aid allocation, and will discuss emergent implications for fairness, privacy, transparency, and community dynamics.

**Talk Title:** Algorithmic Foundations of Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning and Multi-agent Systems

**Abstract:**Policy optimization methods have been integral to the empirical success of comtemporary reinforcement learning (RL). A recent flurry of works endeavored to developing policy optimization methods with provable convergence guarantee. Our works contribute to this recent line of research by investigating non-asymptotic convergence guarantee and improving the dependencies on salient problem parameters.

We start with policy optimization for tabular single-agent RL, where the intrinsic non-concavity poses a significant challenge to obtaining convergence guarantee. By combining natural policy gradient (NPG) methods with entropy regularization, we deliver the first provably linearly converging policy optimization method to the global optimal policy at a dimension-free rate, assuming access to exact policy evaluation. Going beyond entropy regularization, we design a novel policy optimization method that accommodates various choices of regularizers by leveraging Bregman divergence and mirror descent and provably works even when the regularizer lacks strong convexity and smoothness.

In the presence of multiple agents, the goal of policy optimization is to find an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE), preferably through an independent learning process. Noticeably, existing analyses on learning NE for competitive games fall short of characterizing the last-iterate of the learning algorithm in a dimension-free manner. We make progress by designing novel extragradient policy optimization methods that converge to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) of competitive games at a dimension-free linear rate, enabling learning approximate NE without introducing additional assumptions typically needed in prior results. We further extend our algorithms and the accompanying analysis to competitive Markov games and multi-player zero-sum polymatrix games.

**Talk Title:**Inferring networks and behaviors from novel data for critical decision-making

**Abstract:** In an interconnected and fast-moving world, effective policymaking increasingly relies on understanding complex human networks and dynamic behaviors. Novel, high-frequency data sources, such as cell phones and search engines, introduce new opportunities to capture these networks and behaviors at scale. However, there remain substantial gaps between real-world systems and what is recorded in data, such as incomplete networks, unlabeled data, and unknown causal mechanisms. My research seeks to close these gaps by developing methods in data science and machine learning to infer robust signals about real-world networks and behaviors from novel data sources. Using these methods, I derive behavioral insights and build policy tools for high-stakes societal challenges, from pandemic response to political polarization to supply chain disruptions.

In this talk, I will focus on my research related to pandemic response. Specifically, I will cover two lines of work: (1) inferring fine-grained mobility networks from aggregated location data and modeling the spread of COVID- 19, (2) developing machine learning systems to accurately detect vaccine seeking and discover the concerns of vaccine holdouts from anonymized search logs. The findings from these works informed public health policies for reopening, reducing disparities, and distributing vaccines. More broadly, these works demonstrate the potential for large-scale data and computation to aid policymakers, paving a new way to support critical decision-making across domains.

**Talk Title:** Antihypertensive drug repurposing for dementia prevention: target trial emulations in two large-scale electronic health record systems

**Abstract:** Alzheimer’s disease (AD)—the most common type of dementia—affects 5.7 million people in the US and costs about $250 billion annually. Since there are no disease-modifying therapies to date, repurposing FDA-approved drugs preventing dementia onset offers an expedited path to reduce the impact of this epidemic. Beyond age, type 2 diabetes and hypertension are two major risk factors for dementia onset. However, mixed results are emerging from prior observational studies contrasting various antihypertensive drug classes, including Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), and Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB).

To address this complexity and evaluate the repurposing potential of antihypertensives with different mechanisms of action, we deployed a causal inference approach accounting for the competing risk of death in emulated clinical trials using two distinct electronic health record (EHR) systems, one from the UK Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) and the other from the US Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR). We performed intention-to-treat analyses among patients aged 50 or older at baseline, applying Inverse Propensity score of Treatment Weighting to balance the two treatment arms with respect to a set of confounders curated by cardiologists and neurologists. Specifically, we compared antihypertensive treatment initiation with any of seven ARBs vs any of eleven ACE inhibitors.

In the US RPDR database, a total of 45,206 patients were eligible to participate in the emulated target trial. Treatment initiation with any of the seven ARBs was associated with lower hazard of all-cause mortality (HR=1.16 [95% CI: 1.10-1.23]) and lower cause-specific hazard of dementia onset (HR=1.34 [95% CI: 1.27-1.42]) in cause-specific Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) models, after accounting for prolonged survival, relative to treatment initiation with any of the eleven ACE inhibitors. In addition, within the ARB drug class, the gap in the dementia risk difference over time was more pronounced among patients initiating on compounds that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Results of the competing risks analysis were robust to the structure of the outcome models (i.e., Cox PH vs nonparametric). The directionality and strength of our findings were similar in the UK CPRD database.

Target trial emulations in two large-scale EHR systems suggest that treatment initiation with BBB-crossing ARBs might reduce the risk of dementia among hypertensive patients. Ongoing work includes the conduct of a mediation analysis in the two considered cohorts to assess the role played by enhanced blood pressure control towards dementia prevention.

**Talk Title:**A Nonstochastic Control Approach to Optimization

**Abstract:** In the modern deep learning pipeline, selecting the best optimization algorithm and the associated set of hyperparameters for a particular problem instance is crucial. The choice of the optimizer can significantly influence the performance of the trained model. However, this is a nonconvex task, and a result, iterative optimization methods such as hypergradient descent lack global optimality guarantees in general.

We propose an online nonstochastic control methodology for mathematical optimization. First, we formalize the setting of meta-optimization, an online learning formulation of learning the best optimization algorithm from a class of methods. The meta-optimization problem over gradient-based methods can be framed as a feedback control problem over the choice of hyperparameters, including the learning rate, momentum, and the preconditioner.

Although the original optimal control problem is nonconvex, we show how recent methods from online nonstochastic control using convex relaxations can be used to overcome the challenge of nonconvexity, and obtain regret guarantees against the best offline solution. This guarantees that in meta-optimization, given a sequence of optimization problems, we can learn a method that attains convergence comparable to that of the best optimization method in hindsight from a class of methods. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that our meta-optimization algorithm can continuously improve given problem instances, and become competitive with the best tuned method among a class of methods.

**Talk Title:**Flat minima generalize for low-rank matrix recovery

**Abstract:**Empirical evidence suggests that for a variety of overparameterized nonlinear models, most notably in neural network training, the growth of the loss around a minimizer strongly impacts its performance. Flat minima — those around which the loss grows slowly — appear to generalize well. This work takes a step towards understanding this phenomenon by focusing on the simplest class of overparameterized nonlinear models: those arising in low-rank matrix recovery. We analyze overparameterized matrix and bilinear sensing, robust PCA, covariance matrix estimation, and single hidden layer neural networks with quadratic activation functions. In all cases, we show that flat minima, measured by the trace of the Hessian, exactly recover the ground truth under standard statistical assumptions.

**Bio:**Dongqi Fu is a final-year Ph.D. Candidate majoring in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is interested on developing data mining and machine learning algorithms on graph data (i.e., non-IID, relational, non-grid, non-Euclidean data). Moreover, the real-world graph data can be (1) related to the temporal information (i.e., time-evolving topological structures, time-evolving node/graph features/labels, etc.) and (2) imperfect (i.e., missing features, scarce labels, hard-to-interpret, redundant, privacy-leaking, robustness-lacking, etc.). Hence, his research focuses on investigating (1) Natural Dynamics (e.g., leveraging spatial-temporal properties of graphs) and (2) Artificial Dynamics (e.g., augmenting and pruning graph components) in Graph Mining, Graph Representations, and Graph Neural Networks to achieve task performance upgrades in accuracy, efficiency, explanation, privacy, fairness, etc., and he is also keen on Graph Data Management and Graph Theory. He used to be a research scientist intern at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and Meta AI for graph research and applications.

**Talk Title:**Towards Powerful Graph Learning via Natural and Artificial Dynamics

**Abstract:**In the era of big data, the relationship between entities has become much more complex than ever before. As a kind of relational data structure, graphs (or networks) attract much research attention for dealing with this  
unprecedented phenomenon.

In the long run, graph learning methods face two general challenges when adapting to the complexities of the real world. Firstly, the graph structure and features may change over time (i.e., time-evolving topological structures, time-evolving node/graph features/labels, etc.). The resulting problems include but are not limited to ignoring entity temporal correlation, overlooking causality discovery, computation inefficiency, non-  
generalization, etc. Secondly, the initial topological structure and node or graph features may be imperfect (e.g., having construction errors, sampling noises, missing features, scarce labels, hard-to-interpret, redundant, privacy-leaking, robustness-lacking, etc.). The corresponding problems include but are not limited to non- robustness, indiscriminative representations, non-generalization, etc.

Hence, this research talk will concentrate on investigating how to study (1) Natural Dynamics (e.g., leveraging spatial-temporal properties of graphs) and (2) Artificial Dynamics (e.g., augmenting and pruning graph components) for Graph Mining, Graph Representations, and Graph Neural Networks to achieve task performance upgrades in accuracy, efficiency, trustworthiness, etc.

**Talk Title:**The Measure and Mismeasure of Fairness

**Abstract:** The field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last decade, several formal, mathematical definitions of fairness have gained prominence. Here we first  
assemble and categorize these definitions into two broad families: (1) those that constrain the effects of decisions on disparities; and (2) those that constrain the effects of legally protected characteristics, like race and gender, on decisions. We then show, analytically and empirically, that both families of definitions typically result in strongly Pareto dominated decision policies. For example, in the case of college admissions, adhering to popular formal conceptions of fairness would simultaneously result in lower student-body diversity and a less academically prepared class, relative to what one could achieve by explicitly tailoring admissions policies to achieve desired outcomes. In this sense, requiring that these fairness definitions hold can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect. In contrast to axiomatic notions of fairness, we argue that the equitable design of algorithms requires grappling with their context-specific consequences, akin to the equitable design of policy. We conclude by listing several open challenges in fair machine learning and offering strategies to ensure algorithms are better aligned with policy goals.

**Talk Title:**Computational Approaches for Studying Dietary Behaviors with Digital Traces

**Abstract:**Human dietary habits shape our health, daily life, societies, the environment, and life on earth. However, it remains challenging to understand and attempt to change dietary behaviors using traditional methods due to  
measurement and causal identification challenges.

In this talk, I will describe computational and causal approaches leveraging large-scale passively sensed digital traces to shed new light on our dietary behaviors and derive novel scientific insights. I study dietary behaviors in two contexts: campus-wide and worldwide, based on digital traces capturing behaviors of tens of thousands of people on campus and millions of internet users.

First, I will present studies based on situated on-campus food purchase logs. The first study reveals how, when a person acquires a new eating partner on campus or has a meal together, the healthiness of their food choice shifts significantly in the direction of their new eating partner’s dietary patterns. Second, I will describe a study leveraging online information-seeking traces (Google search query logs). Studying worldwide dietary behaviors, I identify and describe global shifts in dietary interests during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, I critically investigate the limits to how much computational approaches can reveal about dietary behaviors in the general population. I outline a framework for reasoning about biases of digital traces and present a case study of food consumption in Switzerland.

Overall, these novel scientific findings and methodological advances contribute to the existing knowledge about human dietary behaviors and inform the design of food systems, policies, and interventions.

**Talk Title:**Exploring and Learning in Sparse Linear MDPs without Computationally Intractable Oracles

**Abstract:**The key assumption underlying linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is that the learner has access to a known feature map from state-action pairs to d-dimensional vectors, and that the rewards and transitions are linear functions in this representation. But where do these features come from? In the absence of expert domain knowledge, a tempting strategy is to use the “kitchen sink” approach and hope that the true features are included in a much larger set of potential features. In this work we revisit linear MDPs from the perspective of feature selection. In a k-sparse linear MDP, there is an unknown subset of size k containing all the relevant features, and the goal is to learn a near-optimal policy in only poly(k, log d) interactions with the environment. Our main result is the first polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. In contrast, earlier works either made prohibitively strong assumptions that obviated the need for exploration, or required solving computationally intractable optimization problems.

As a corollary of our main result, we give an algorithm for learning a near-optimal policy in block MDPs whose decoding function is a low-depth decision tree; the algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time and takes a polynomial number of samples. This can be seen as a reinforcement learning analogue of classic results in computational learning theory. Furthermore, it gives a natural model where improving the sample complexity via representation learning is computationally feasible.

**Bio:**I am a fifth-year PhD student at Department of Statistics, Stanford University, advised by Professors Emmanuel Candès and Dominik Rothenhäusler. Prior to Stanford, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Tsinghua University. My research aims at developing modern statistical methods for trusted inference and decision-making, that are simple, robust, generalizable, and minimal in assumptions. A large proportion of my work develops model-free methods that provide solid guarantees for the use of black-box prediction models in complex scientific discovery and decision-making processes, especially with applications to drug discovery. In addition, I study how to generalize causal inference to new contexts and new decision rules; my work under this theme concerns methodological and empirical foundations for the replicability, robustness, and transportability of causal effects, as well as algorithms and theories for policy learning with offline data from sequential experiments.

**Talk Title:**Model-free selective inference with conformal p-values and its application in drug discovery

**Abstract:**In decision-making or scientific discovery pipelines such as job hiring and drug discovery, before any resource-intensive step, there is often an initial screening step that uses predictions from a machine learning model to shortlist a few candidates from a large pool. We introduce a framework that allows using any prediction model to select candidates whose unobserved outcomes exceed user-specified values, while rigorously controlling the false positives. Given a set of calibration data that are exchangeable with the test sample, we leverage conformal inference ideas to construct p-values that allow us to shortlist candidates with exact false discovery rate (FDR) control. In addition, I will discuss new ideas to further deal with covariate shifts between calibration and test samples, a scenario that occurs in almost all such problems including drug discovery, hiring, causal inference, and healthcare. Our methods are flexible wrappers around any complex model. In practical drug discovery tasks, our methods greatly narrow the set of promising drug candidates to manageable sizes while maintaining rigorous FDR control.

**Talk Title:** Socially responsible NLP via causal and moral principles

**Abstract:**We are currently navigating through an era marked by numerous social challenges: the COVID pandemic, climate change, as well as escalating concerns on the safety of large language models (LLMs). With all these concerning challenges, I establish my research on socially responsible NLP using causal and moral principles. Specifically, I use causal inference to benchmark existing LLMs’ reasoning ability, analyze the failure modes of LLMs, and interpret the relation between data collection and model learning. Further, I combine interdisciplinary knowledge from moral philosophy to design socially-important moral questions to test LLMs, and propose standards for future models to be more morally safe. In this talk, I will introduce my research on these lines, and put forward an outlook for socially responsible NLP.

**Talk Title:**ARUBA: Efficient and Adaptive Meta-learning with Provable Guarantees

**Abstract:**Meta-learning has recently emerged as an important direction for multi-task learning, dynamic environments, and federated settings. We present a theoretical framework for designing practical meta-learning methods that integrates natural formalizations of task-similarity with the extensive literature on online convex optimization and sequential prediction algorithms. Our approach, which works by learning surrogate losses bounding the within-task regret of base learning algorithms, enables the task-similarity to be learned adaptively and leads to straightforward derivations of average-case regret bounds that improve if the tasks are similar. We highlight how our theory can be extended to numerous settings, especially for deriving multi-task guarantees for bandit algorithms.

**Talk Title:** Sentence-level Media Bias Analysis through Content Structures Modeling

**Abstract:** News media plays a vast role not only by providing information, but also by selecting, packaging, and organizing the information to shape public opinions. Media outlets are becoming more partisan and polarized nowadays, and developing sophisticated models to detect media bias becomes necessary. Most prior work in the NLP community focused on detecting media bias either at the source level or the article level. However, articles consist of multiple sentences, and each sentence serves different purposes in narrating a news story. We aim to identify media bias at a more fine-grained sentence level, and pinpoint bias sentences that seek to implant ideological bias and manipulate public opinions. Sentence-level media bias can be very subtle and tends to be presented in a neutral and factual tone. Our research demonstrates that modeling the content structures of news articles can reveal such implicit ideological bias.

**Talk Title:**Decoding Real-World Evidence: Bridging GAMs and LLMs to Expose “Death by Round Numbers”

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing natural language processing, but combining their implicit knowledge with explicit statistical machine learning models is an ongoing challenge. To bridge these systems, we propose to use generalized additive models (GAMs). GAMs decompose complex outcomes into separable component functions, creating a modular structure that fits seamlessly into LLM context windows. As a result, GAMs can unleash the power of LLMs for traditional machine learning tasks.

We demonstrate an exciting application of this perspective: automated surprise finding. Real-world data science grapples with complications like hidden confounding, often necessitating manual model inspections by domain experts. For instance, treatment-based confounding in medical data may inadvertently teach data- driven systems to perpetuate inherent biases. However, by bridging GAMs with LLMs, we harness the vast knowledge reservoir within LLMs to auto-detect anomalies that appear to contradict domain expertise.

This approach not only improves machine learning models, but also reveals quirks of the underlying system. Using this combination of glass-box GAMs and foundational LLMs, we evaluate four datasets of real-world medical evidence, identifying two characteristic types of medical biases: (1) discontinuous risk at sharp treatment thresholds and (2) counter-causal paradoxes where aggressive treatment reduces perceived risk.

Finally, we present the TalkToEBM package to establish this bridge between GAMs and LLMs and offer a lens to automatically identify surprising effects in statistical models.

**Talk Title:**Measuring Language By Social Groups in Natural Language Processing

**Abstract:**Language data embeds social identities, behaviors, and beliefs. That is, who we are is expressed through how we communicate. My research leverages natural language processing (NLP) methods to measure large-scale language patterns across social groups, and uses these measurements to answer sociolinguistic questions and inform model development. First, I’ll present studies quantifying community-specific words and meanings across two domains: online discussion forums and scholarly literature. In these studies, I leverage perspectives from sociolinguistics to relate communities’ use of distinctive language to various social factors, such as member loyalty, activity, network density, audience, and cross-community impact. Second, I’ll present an ongoing study analyzing the effects of large language model (LLM) pretraining data practices on text spanning a range of socioeconomic and geographic origins. Model developers often implement filters to extract “high-quality” data to train models. I’ll show whether notions of “quality” vary across popular LLMs’ filtering strategies, and what kinds of webtext are disproportionately removed during these curation processes. Finally, I will conclude by discussing challenges and questions raised by my research that point towards future directions for computational social science and NLP.

**Talk Title:**Foundations of Multisensory Artificial Intelligence

**Abstract:**The study of multisensory intelligence aims to understand the computational principles of multisensory integration and design practical AI systems that can similarly learn from multiple sensory inputs such as text, speech, audio, video, real-world sensors, wearable devices, and medical data. These multisensory AI systems can support human physical, emotional, and social well-being, enable multimedia content processing, and enhance real-world autonomous agents, which hold great promise for impact in many scientific areas with practical benefits.

Multisensory intelligence brings unique challenges to machine learning given the heterogeneity and interactions often found between modalities. In this talk, I will discuss my recent research on the foundations of multisensory intelligence through a new theoretical framework formalizing how modalities interact with each other to give rise to new information for a task. These interactions are the basic building blocks in all multimodal problems, and their quantification enables users to understand their multimodal datasets and design principled approaches to learn these interactions. To further learn temporal interactions from sequential data, I will present cross-modal attention and multimodal transformers which now underpin many of today’s multimodal foundation models. Finally, I will discuss broader real-world applications of scaling up multisensory learning to many modalities and tasks: (1) aiding mental health practitioners in their treatment by predicting daily mood fluctuations in patients using multimodal smartphone data, (2) supporting doctors in cancer prognosis using genomics readings and pathology images, and (3) enabling robust control of physical robots using cameras and touch sensors.

**Talk Title:**Efficient Deep Learning with Sparsity — Algorithms, Systems and Applications

**Abstract:** Deep learning has catalyzed advancements across numerous scientific and engineering fields. It is also a driving force behind many successful real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, large language models, and generative AI. Despite its remarkable accomplishments, the computational requirements of deep learning have surged dramatically. For instance, the model size of large language models is increased from 0.11B parameters in GPT-1 to 175B in GPT-3 within three years, an over 1500X growth. However, the pace of hardware acceleration has slowed down in the post-Moore era. This raises a large (and potentially growing) gap between the supply and demand of AI computing.

In this talk, I will introduce my research efforts on efficient deep learning with sparsity. I will first talk about my efforts on developing efficient sparse algorithms and systems. I will mainly focus on TorchSparse that effectively translates the theoretical savings from activation sparsity to practical speedups. It is three times faster than the leading industry solution from NVIDIA. I will then delve into my efforts on incorporating sparsity into different applications, such as computer vision, robotics and high-energy physics. To conclude, I will provide a glimpse into some of my ongoing research projects and outline my long-term research vision.

At the same time, the complexity of the data and the presence of unknowable systematics pose significant challenges to robustly characterizing these signatures through conventional methods.

I will describe how overcoming these challenges will require a qualitative shift in our approach to statistical inference in astrophysics, bringing together several recent advances in generative modeling, differentiable programming, and simulation-based inference. I will showcase applications of these methods to diverse astrophysical systems, emphasizing how these will drive progress on key questions in astro- and particle-physics over the next decade.

**Talk Title:**Learning from a Biased Sample

**Abstract:** The empirical risk minimization approach to data-driven decision making assumes that we can learn a decision rule from training data drawn under the same conditions as the ones we want to deploy it in. However, in a number of settings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased, and that some groups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be under- or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this setting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield rules that perform well at deployment. We propose a model of sampling bias called Gamma-biased sampling, where observed covariates can affect the probability of sample selection arbitrarily much but the amount of unexplained variation in the probability of sample selection is bounded by a constant factor. Applying the distributionally robust optimization framework, we propose a method for learning a decision rule that minimizes the worst-case risk incurred under a family of test distributions that can generate the training distribution under Gamma-biased sampling. We apply a result of Rockafellar and Uryasev to show that this problem is equivalent to an augmented convex risk minimization problem. We give statistical guarantees for learning a model that is robust to sampling bias via the method of sieves, and propose a deep learning algorithm whose loss function captures our robust learning target. We empirically validate our proposed method in simulations and a case study on ICU length of stay prediction.

**Talk Title:**Towards Useful AI Interpretability for Humans via Interactive AI Explanations

**Abstract:** Although the plethora of eXplainable AI (XAI) approaches are validated to reflect the model behavior faithfully, how humans can understand and further use AI explanations still needs to be explored. Therefore, we conducted two human studies to investigate how much AI explanations can be useful for end users in Computer Vision and NLP fields, including asking humans to analyze model failures in image classification tasks and simulate model predictions in text classification tasks, respectively. Our results showed that explanations are not always helpful for human understanding in practical tasks of both fields. To gain insights into possible reasons, we examined the gaps between the status quo of XAI techniques and real-world user demands, by surveying 200+ XAI papers and comparing them with the practical user needs. As a result, we found that humans need diverse XAI types to interpret the whole AI system lifecycle. However, there is a lack of one-size-fits-all XAI techniques to cater to the diverse and dynamic human needs in practice. Hence, we propose a Conversational XAI prototype, ConvXAI, as a universal XAI dialogue interface that empowers users to request various XAI questions across AI lifecycle and receive explanations with diverse formats. We applied ConvXAI to improve human performance in the human-AI co-writing tasks. The findings from two studies with 21 users show that ConvXAI is useful for humans in understanding AI feedback and improving writing productivity and quality. Overall, the studies contribute insights into the design space of facilitating useful XAI techniques for humans in practice.

My research focuses on neural-symbolic reasoning, which entails synergistically leveraging the strengths of machine learning systems with symbolic systems such as knowledge graphs and combinatorial optimization solvers. More recently, my research interests have been oriented towards the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), with a special emphasis on improving reliability through scalable oversight (minimal human supervision) such as human-defined principles or factual feedback from real-world interactions.

**Talk Title:**Aligning Large Language and Multimodal Models with Scalable Oversight

**Abstract:** There has been an increasing desire to bridge the gap between what we expect AI systems to generate and what they actually produce. At the forefront of this exploration, we introduce novel methodologies for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs): Principle-Driven Self-Alignment (SELF-ALIGN), Self-Alignment with Principle-Following Reward Models (SALT), and Aligning Large Multimodal Models with Factually-Augmented RLHF (Fact-RLHF). Driven by the aspiration to diminish the constraints of exhaustive human supervision and to magnify the reliability of AI outputs, SELF-ALIGN ingeniously harnesses principle-driven reasoning with LLMs’ generative prowess, crafting content that resonates with human values. Building on this motivation, SALT evolves the alignment landscape further by seamlessly integrating minimal human guidance with reinforcement learning from synthetic preferences, offering a tantalizing glimpse into the future of self-aligned AI agents. Shifting our lens to the multimodal realm, where misalignment often translates into AI “hallucinations” that are inconsistent with the multimodal inputs, Fact-RLHF emerges as a general and scalable solution. By merging RLHF’s strength with factual augmentations, this method not only mitigates misalignments but also pioneers in setting robust standards for AI’s vision-language capabilities.

**Talk Title:**Deep Interpretable Generative Learning for Science and Engineering

**Abstract:**Discriminative and generative AI represent two deep learning paradigms that have sparked a revolution in predicting and generating high-quality realistic images from text prompts. Nonetheless, discriminative learning lacks the capacity to generate data, while deep generative models face challenges in decoding capabilities. A key challenge, which could brought the next breakthrough in AI, lies in the unification of these two paradigms. Moreover, both deep learning approaches are data-hungry and thus does not perform well in data-scarce applications. Furthermore, deep learning suffers from low interpretability; no comprehensive framework exists to describe construction of non-trivial representations and predictions by discriminative models. These drawbacks have posed significant barriers to the adoption of deep learning in applications where a) acquiring supervised data is expensive or infeasible, and b) goals extend beyond data fitting to attain scientific insights. Specifically, deep learning applications are fairly unexplored in fields with rich mathematical and optimization frameworks such as inverse problems, or those in which interpretability matters. This talk discusses the theory and applications of deep learning in data-limited or unsupervised inverse problems. These include applications in radar sensing, Poisson image denoising, and computational neuroscience.

**Talk Title:**Leveraging Large Language Models for Remediation in Mathematics Tutoring: Insights and Challenges

**Abstract:** In this talk, I will present our study of how experienced teachers and large language models (LLMs)  
remediate student mistakes in mathematics and outline the potential of LLMs to support novice tutors  
at scale.

Scaling high-quality tutoring is a major challenge in education. Because of the growing demand, many platforms employ novice tutors who, unlike professional educators, struggle to effectively address student mistakes and thus fail to seize prime learning opportunities for students. In this work, we explore the potential for LLMs to assist math tutors in remediating student mistakes. We analyze thousands of tutoring sessions from novice tutors, which reveal poor pedagogical practices like immediately saying and explaining the solution when responding to student mistakes. We used these findings to build ReMath, a benchmark co-developed with experienced math teachers that deconstructs their thought process for remediation. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art instruct-tuned and dialog models on ReMath. Our findings suggest that although models consistently improve upon original tutor responses, we cannot rely on models alone to remediate mistakes. Providing models with the error type (e.g., the student is guessing) and strategy (e.g., simplify the problem) leads to a 75% improvement in the response quality over models without that information. Nonetheless, despite the improvement, the quality of the best model’s responses still falls short of experienced math teachers. Our work is the first to shed light on the potential and current limitations of using LLMs to provide high-quality learning experiences for both tutors and students at scale.

**Talk Title:** What creates edge of stability, balancing, and catapult

**Abstract:**When large learning rate is used in gradient descent for nonconvex optimization, various phenomena that are not explainable by classical optimization theory can arise, including edge of stability, balancing, and catapult. There are a lot of theoretical works trying to analyze these phenomena, while the high level idea is still missing: it is unclear when and why these phenomena occur. In this talk, I will show that these phenomena are actually various tips of the same iceberg. They occur when the objective function of optimization has some good regularity. This regularity, together with the effect of large learning rate on guiding gradient descent from sharp regions to flatter ones, leads to the control of the largest eigenvalue of Hessian, i.e., sharpness, along the GD trajectory, which results in various phenomena. This result is based on the nontrivial convergence analysis under large learning rate on a family of nonconvex functions of various regularities without Lipschitz gradient which is usually a default assumption in nonconvex optimization. In addition, it contains the first non-asymptotic result on the rate of convergence in this circumstance. Neural network experiments will also be presented to validate this result.

**Talk Title:**Theoretical Insights into Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent in Deep Learning

**Abstract:**Gradient Descent (GD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are fundamental optimization algorithms in machine learning, but their behaviors sometimes defy intuitions from classic optimization and statistical learning theories. In deep learning, GD often exhibits local oscillations while still converging over time. Moreover, SGD-trained models generalize effectively even when overparameterized. In this talk, I will revisit the theories of GD and SGD for classic problems but in new scenarios motivated by deep learning, presenting two novel insights:

(1) For logistic regression with separable data, GD with an arbitrarily large stepsize minimizes empirical risk, potentially in a non-monotonic fashion.

(2) For linear regression and ReLU regression, one-pass SGD and its variants can achieve low excess risk, even in overparameterized regime.

**Talk Title:**High-stakes decisions from low-quality data: AI decision-making for planetary health

**Abstract:** Planetary health recognizes the inextricable link between human health and the health of our planet. Our planet’s growing crises include biodiversity loss, with animal population sizes declining by an average of 70% since 1970, and maternal mortality, with 1 in 49 girls in low-income countries dying from complications in pregnancy or birth.

My research develops data-driven AI decision-making methods to do so, overcoming the messy data ubiquitous in these settings. Here, I’ll present technical advances in multi-armed bandits, robust reinforcement learning, and causal inference, addressing research questions that emerged from on-the-ground challenges across conservation and maternal health. I’ll also discuss bridging the gap from research and practice, with anti-poaching field tests in Cambodia, field visits in Belize and Uganda, and large-scale deployment with SMART conservation software.

**Talk Title:**Learning to Assess Disease and Health At Your Home

**Abstract:** The future of healthcare lies in delivering comprehensive medical services to patients in their own homes. As the global population ages and chronic diseases become increasingly prevalent, objective, longitudinal and reliable health assessment at home becomes crucial for early detection and prevention of hospitalization. Advances in machine learning and smart sensors hold immense potential for transforming in-home healthcare. However, enabling these technologies for at-home clinical applications requires addressing several challenges, including discovering effective biomarkers with accessible vitals, learning from real-world sparse and biased health data, and making ML algorithms reliable for deployment across diverse environments and populations.

In this talk, I will present new learning methods with everyday devices for in-home healthcare that address these challenges. I will first describe a simple self-supervised framework for remote human vitals sensing just using daily smartphones. I will then introduce an AI-powered digital biomarker for Parkinson’s disease that detects the disease, estimates its severity, and tracks its progression using nocturnal breathing signals. Furthermore, I will showcase the potential of AI-based in-home assessment for various diseases and human health sensing, enabling remote monitoring of health-related conditions, timely care and enhancing patient outcomes.

**Talk Title:** Labor advantages drive the greater productivity of faculty at elite universities

**Abstract:**Faculty at prestigious institutions dominate scientific discourse, producing a disproportionate share of all research publications. Environmental prestige can drive such epistemic disparity, but the mechanisms by which it causes increased faculty productivity remain unknown. Here, we combine employment, publication, and federal survey data for 78,802 tenure-track faculty at 262 PhD-granting institutions in the American university system to show through multiple lines of evidence that the greater availability of funded graduate and postdoctoral labor at more prestigious institutions drives the environmental effect of prestige on productivity. In particular, greater environmental prestige leads to larger faculty-led research groups, which drive higher faculty productivity, primarily in disciplines with group collaboration norms. In contrast, productivity does not increase substantially with prestige for faculty publications without group members or for group members themselves. The disproportionate scientific productivity of elite researchers can be largely explained by their substantial labor advantage rather than inherent differences in talent.

**Talk Title:**DProvDB: Differentially Private Query Processing with Multi-Analyst Provenance

**Abstract:**Recent years have witnessed the adoption of differential privacy (DP) in practical database systems like PINQ, FLEX, and PrivateSQL. Such systems allow data analysts to query sensitive data while providing a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee. However, the existing design of these systems does not distinguish data analysts of different privilege levels or trust levels. This design can have an unfair apportion of the privacy budget among the data analyst if treating them as a single entity, or waste the privacy budget if considering them as non-colluding parties and answering their queries independently. In this paper, we propose DProvDB, a fine-grained privacy provenance framework for the multi-analyst scenario that tracks the privacy loss to each single data analyst. Under this framework, when given a fixed privacy budget, we build algorithms that maximize the number of queries that could be answered accurately and apportion the privacy budget according to the privilege levels of the data analysts.

**Talk Title:**Towards Trustworthy AI: Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms that Produce All Good Models

**Abstract:**Machine learning has been increasingly deployed for high-stakes decisions that deeply impact people’s lives. However, not all models can be trusted. To ensure the safe and efficient utilization of machine learning models in the decision-making process, we change both model training and evaluation steps within the standard machine learning pipeline. In this talk, I will introduce our new paradigm, which shifts from finding a single optimal model to enumerating all good interpretable models. This paradigm allows users an unprecedented level of control over model choice among all models that are approximately equally good. I will present algorithms used to find the set of all good models, discuss how this set enables practitioners to explore alternative models that might have desirable properties beyond what could be expressed within a loss function, and show applications.

* [Description](#description)

  [**The Rising Stars in Data Science workshop**](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/event/rising-stars-in-data-science-workshop-autumn-2024/), hosted **November 14-15** by the University of California San Diego in collaboration with the University of Chicago and Stanford University, **focuses on celebrating and fast tracking the careers of exceptional data scientists** at a critical inflection point in their career: the transition to postdoctoral scholar, research scientist, industry research position, or tenure track position. Over the past four years, the Rising Stars workshop has hosted over 130 Rising Stars from nearly 40 institutions.

  This fall, the fifth annual Rising Stars workshop will showcase the exciting, innovative data science initiatives at UC San Diego, UChicago and Stanford University. This event will provide PhD students and postdocs the opportunity to plug into these networks, platforms, and opportunities. The workshop also aims to increase representation and diversity in data science by providing a platform and a supportive mentoring network to **navigate academic careers in data science**. All graduate students and postdocs, including those who belong to groups underrepresented in data science, are encouraged to apply, including but not limited to people of all racial, ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, sexual orientations, genders, and persons with disabilities.

  The two-day workshop will feature career and research panels, networking and mentoring opportunities, and research talks from the Rising Stars. Participants will gain insights from faculty panels on career development questions such as: how to start your academic career in data science; how to strategically sustain your career through research collaborations, publications, and skill development; and how to form meaningful interdisciplinary collaborations in data science with industry and government partners. Participants will also hear inspiring keynote talks from established, cutting-edge leaders in data science.

**Bio:**Maria Antoniak is a PhD candidate in Information Science at Cornell University. Her research focuses on unsupervised natural language processing methods and applications to computational social science and cultural analytics. Her work translates methods from natural language processing to insights about communities and self-disclosure by modeling personal experiences shared in online communities. She has a master’s degree in computational linguistics from the University of Washington and a bachelor’s degree in humanities from the University of Notre Dame, and she has completed research internships at Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

**Talk Title:**Modeling Personal Experiences Shared in Online Communities

**Talk Abstract:**Written communications about personal experiences—and the emotions, narratives, and values that they contain—can be both rhetorically powerful and statistically difficult to model. The first goal of my research is to use natural language processing methods to represent complex personal experiences and self-disclosures communicated in online communities. Two fruitful sites for this research are online communities grounded in structured cultural experiences (books, games) and online communities grounded in healthcare experiences (childbirth, contraception, pain management). These communities situate personal opinions and stories in social contexts of reception, expectation, and judgment. The second goal of my research is critical re-examination of measurement methods: I probe models designed for traditional natural language processing tasks involving large, generic datasets by exploring their results on small, socially-specific datasets that are popular in cultural analytics and computational social science.

**Bio:**Arjun studies the security of machine learning systems, with a focus on adversarial and distributed learning. His work has exposed new vulnerabilities in learning algorithms, along with the development of a theoretical framework to analyze them. He was a finalist for the 2020 Bede Liu Best Dissertation Award, and won the 2019 Yan Huo \*94 Graduate Fellowship and 2018 SEAS Award for Excellence at Princeton University. He received the 2018 Siemens FutureMakers Fellowship in Machine Learning, and was a finalist for the 2017 Bell Labs Prize. He is currently a postdoctoral scholar at UChicago with Ben Zhao and Nick Feamster.

**Talk Title:**The Role of Data Geometry in Adversarial Machine Learning

**Talk Abstract:** Understanding the robustness of machine learning systems has become a problem of critical interest due to their increasing deployment in safety critical systems. Of particular interest are adversarial examples, which are maliciously pertrubed test-time examples designed to induce misclassification. Most research on adversarial examples has focused on developing better attacks and ad hoc defenses, resulting in an attacker-defender arms race.

In this talk, we will step away from this paradigm and show how fundamental bounds on learning in the presence of adversarial examples can be obtained by viewing the problem through an information-theoretic lens. For fixed but arbitrary distributions, we demonstrate lower bounds on both the 0-1 and cross-entropy losses for robust learning. We compare these bounds to the performance of state-of-the-art robust classifiers and analyze the impact of different layers on robustness.

**Bio:**Lingjiao Chen is a PhD candidate in the computer sciences department at Stanford University. He is broadly interested in machine learning, data management and optimization. Working with Matei Zaharia and James Zou, he is currently exploring the fast-growing marketplaces of artificial intelligence and data. His work has been published at premier conferences and journals such as ICML, NeurIPS, SIGMOD and PVLDB, and partially supported by a Google fellowship.

**Talk Title:**Understanding and Exploiting Machine Learning Prediction APIs

**Talk Abstract:**Machine Learning (ML) prediction APIs are a fast-growing industry and an important part of ML as a service. For example, one could use Google prediction API to classify an image for $0.0015 or to classify the sentiment of a text passage for $0.00025. While many such services are available, the heterogeneity in their price and performance makes it challenging for users to decide which API or combination of APIs to use for their own data.

In this talk, I will present FrugalML, a principled framework that jointly learns the strength and weakness of each API on different data, and performs an efficient optimization to automatically identify the best sequential strategy to adaptively use the available APIs within a budget constraint. Our theoretical analysis shows that natural sparsity in the formulation can be leveraged to make FrugalML efficient. We conduct systematic experiments using ML APIs from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Baidu and other providers for tasks including facial emotion recognition, sentiment analysis and speech recognition. Across various tasks, FrugalML can achieve up to 90% cost reduction while matching the accuracy of the best single API, or up to 5% better accuracy while matching the best API’s cost. If time permits, I will also discuss recent follow-up studies on API performance shifts and multi-label APIs.

**Talk Title:**Crypt$\epsilon$: Crypto-Assisted Differential Privacy on Untrusted Servers

**Talk Abstract:**Differential privacy (DP) is currently the de-facto standard for achieving privacy in data analysis, which is typically implemented either in the ”central” or ”local” model. The local model has been more popular for commercial deployments as it does not require a trusted data collector. This increased privacy, however, comes at the cost of utility and algorithmic expressibility as compared to the central model.

In this talk, I will be presenting Crypt$\epsilon$, a system and programming framework that (1) achieves the accuracy guarantees and algorithmic expressibility of the central model (2) without any trusted data collector like in the local model. Crypt$\epsilon$ achieves the ”best of both worlds” by employing two non-colluding untrusted servers that run DP programs on encrypted data from the data owners. In theory, straightforward implementations of DP programs using off-the-shelf secure multi-party computation tools can achieve the above goal. However, in practice, they are beset with many challenges like poor performance and tricky security proofs. To this end, Crypt$\epsilon$ allows data analysts to author logical DP programs that are automatically translated to secure protocols that work on encrypted data. These protocols ensure that the untrusted servers learn nothing more than the noisy outputs, thereby guaranteeing DP for all Crypt$\epsilon$ programs. Crypt$\epsilon$ supports a rich class of DP programs that can be expressed via a small set of transformation and measurement operators followed by arbitrary post-processing. Further, I will talk about a novel performance optimization that leverages the fact that the output is noisy. Consequently, Crypt$\epsilon$ achieves performance that is practical for real-world usage.

**Talk Title:**Data-Efficient Text Classifier for Robust NLP

**Talk Abstract:**With the unprecedented progress in deep learning architectures, large-scale training, and learning algorithms, pre-trained models have become pivotal in AI. Concurrently, the definition of model robustness has transited to broader aspects: data-efficiency, model resilience, fairness, and faithfulness. In this talk, I will focus on data-efficient and model resilience aspects and present my efforts to build robust text classifiers where we introduced discrete latent variables into the generative story. In modeling we parameterized the distributions using standard neural architectures used in conditional language modeling. Our training objective combines generative pretraining and discriminative finetuning. The results shows that our generative classifiers outperform discriminative baselines including BERT-style models across several challenging experimental settings.

**Talk Title:**High-Dimensional Asymptotics for Phase Retrieval with Structured Sensing Matrices.

**Talk Abstract:**Phase Retrieval is the problem of recovering an unknown complex-valued signal vector from the magnitudes of several linear measurements. This problem arises in applications like X-ray crystallography, where it is infeasible to acquire the phase of the measurements. In this talk, I will describe some results regarding the analysis of this problem in the high-dimensional asymptotic regime where the number of measurements and the signal dimension diverge proportionally so that their ratio remains fixed. The measurement mechanism in phase retrieval is specified by a sensing matrix. A limitation of existing high-dimensional analysis of this problem is that they model this matrix as a random matrix with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian entries. In practice, this matrix is highly structured with limited randomness. I will describe a correction to the i.i.d. sensing model, known as the sub-sampled Haar sensing model, which faithfully captures a crucial orthogonality property of realistic sensing matrices. For the Haar sensing model, I will present a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of commonly used spectral estimators for solving the phase retrieval problem. This characterization can be leveraged to tune certain parameters involved in the spectral estimator optimally. The resulting estimator is information-theoretically optimal. Next, I will describe an empirical universality phenomenon: the performance curves derived for the Haar model accurately describe the observed performance curves for realistic sensing matrices. Finally, I will present recent progress towards obtaining a theoretical understanding of this universality phenomenon that causes practical sensing matrices to behave like Haar sensing matrices.

**Talk Title:**Building Language Technologies for Analyzing Online Activism

**Talk Abstract:**While recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have greatly enhanced our ability to analyze online text, distilling broad social-oriented research questions into tasks concrete enough for NLP models remains challenging. In this work, we develop state-of-the-art NLP models grounded in frameworks from social psychology in order to analyze two social media movements: online media coverage of the #MeToo movement in 2017-2018 and tweets about #BlackLivesMatter protests in 2020. In the first part, we show that despite common perception of the #MeToo movement as empowering, media coverage of events often portrayed women as sympathetic but unpowerful. In the second, we show that positive emotions like hope and optimism are prevalent in tweets with pro-BlackLivesMatter hashtags and significantly correlated with the presence of on-the-ground protests, whereas anger and disgust are not. These results contrast stereotypical portrayals of protesters as perpetuating anger and outrage. Overall, our work provides insight into social movements and debunks harmful stereotypes. We aim to bridge the gap between NLP, where models are often not designed to address social-oriented questions, and computational social science, where state-of-the-art NLP has often been underutilized.

**Talk Title:** Community-based designs of Human-centered AI and Public Policy for Global Inclusion, Resilience, and Sustainability

**Talk Abstract:** The field of computational social science has been traditionally focused on analyzing large-scale human and social dynamics in social media. However, millions of people from historically disadvantaged communities, harmed by climate change, structural inequalities, and human rights violations, remain missing from the digital databases, Internet traces, census records, and mainstream policy design processes. While data-intensive algorithms could help improve the livelihood of these at-risk populations, the key challenge is that their prejudiced designs overlook the interconnected nature of colonial, socioeconomic, institutional, and ecological processes that govern our world and amplify algorithmic harms.

In this talk, I will present a data science research program demonstrating how we can bring digitally invisible communities to the center of designing data-intensive public interest computing systems for collaborative public policy decision-making concerning sustainable development. During the talk, I will discuss resilience and adaptation mechanisms required to address climate disasters and agricultural market failures that have led to over 300000 farmer suicides, food systems crises, and forced displacements of women and children in the Global South. Finally, I will showcase how human-AI collaboration system designs, coupled with participatory and remote sensing satellite datasets, can advance equitable policymaking and make socio-technical systems (such as markets and food systems) more resilient to the perils of sustainability.

By studying the interconnected dynamics of socioeconomic and environmental processes and their impact on digitally missing and underserved communities, this scholarship broadens the horizon of computational social science research beyond the Internet ecosystems. It has already led to the informed data science research and policy program in Data-driven Humanitarian Mapping that convenes a global community of stakeholders from industry, academia, NGOs, and governments to tackle overarching sustainability challenges posed by climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Talk Title:** Malicious Attacks against Deep Reinforcement Learning Interpretations

**Talk Abstract:**The past years have witnessed the rapid development of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which incorporates deep learning into the solution and makes decisions from unstructured input data without manual engineering of the state space. However, the adoption of deep neural networks makes the decision-making process of DRL opaque and lacking transparency. Motivated by this, various interpretation methods for DRL have been proposed. Those interpretation methods make an implicit assumption that they are performed in a reliable and secure environment. However, given their data-driven nature, these DRL interpretation methods themselves are potentially susceptible to malicious manipulations. In spite of the prevalence of malicious attacks, there is no existing work studying the possibility and feasibility of malicious attacks against DRL interpretations. To bridge this gap, in my work, I investigated the vulnerability of DRL interpretation methods. Specifically, I introduced the first study of the adversarial attacks against DRL interpretations, and proposed an optimization framework based on which the optimal adversarial attack strategy can be derived. In addition, I also studied the vulnerability of DRL interpretation methods to the model poisoning attacks, and present an algorithmic framework to rigorously formulate the proposed model poisoning attack. Finally, I conducted both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed malicious attacks against DRL interpretations.

**Talk Title:**My Data is None of Your Business: Separation of Concerns for Privacy through Modular Privacy Flows.

**Talk Abstract:**This wide-scale deployment of tiny sensors, coupled with improvements in recognition and data mining algorithms, will enable numerous new applications for personal and societal benefits. But, we have also seen many undesired data-driven applications deployed, such as price discrimination, shopping behavior persuasion. Once one’s data is out of users’ direct control, it may potentially be used at places and times far removed from its original context. How can we computer scientists assure users that a data-driven world is the one everyone wants to live in?

In this talk, I will introduce my thesis work on separating concerns for privacy through a new software design pattern, named Modular Privacy Flows. Rather than continuing to build privacy support in an ad-hoc manner, my research demonstrates how we can separate the privacy logic from the application logic. This separation can help users gain independent and unified control of their data while reducing the burdens of developers and auditors on ensuring privacy.

**Talk Title:**Practical Algorithms for Interactive Learning with Generic Function Classes

**Talk Abstract:**We consider interactive learning in the realizable setting and develop a general framework to handle problems ranging from best arm identification to active classification. We begin our investigation with the observation that agnostic algorithms cannot be minimax-optimal in the realizable setting. Hence, we design novel algorithms for the realizable setting that are nearly minimax optimal, computationally efficient, and general-purpose, accommodating a wide variety of function classes including kernel methods, Holder smooth functions, and convex functions.  The sample complexities of our algorithms can be quantified in terms of well-known quantities like the extended teaching dimension and haystack dimension. However, unlike algorithms based directly on those combinatorial quantities, our algorithms are computationally efficient. To achieve computational efficiency, our algorithms sample from the version space using Monte Carlo “hit-and-run” algorithms instead of maintaining the version space explicitly. Our approach has two key strengths. First, it is simple, consisting of two unifying, greedy algorithms. Second, our algorithms have the capability to seamlessly leverage prior knowledge that is often available and useful in practice. In addition to our new theoretical results, we demonstrate empirically that our algorithms are competitive with and in some cases outperform Gaussian process UCB methods. This talk is based on work to appear in NeurIPS 2021.

**Talk Title:**Integrating Machine Learning with Physics-Based Spatial and Temporal Modeling

**Talk Abstract:**Deep learning has achieved great success in numerous areas, and is also seeing increasing interest in scientific applications. However, challenges still remain: scientific phenomena are difficult to model, and can also be limited by a lack of training data. As a result, scientific machine learning approaches are being developed by incorporating domain knowledge into the machine learning process to enable more accurate and general predictions. One such popular approach, colloquially known as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), incorporates domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss function. I will discuss the challenges associated with such an approach, and show that by changing the learning paradigm to curriculum regularization or sequence-to-sequence learning, we can achieve significantly lower error. Another approach, colloquially known as ODE-Nets, aims to couple dynamical systems/numerical methods with neural networks. I will discuss how exploiting techniques from numerical analysis for these systems can enable learning continuous, function-to-function mappings for scientific problems.

**Talk Title:**Integrating Human Priorities and Data-Driven Improvements in Allocation of Scarce Homeless Services to Households in Need

**Talk Abstract:**Homelessness is a major public health issue in the United States that has gained visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite efforts at the federal level, rates of homelessness are not decreasing. Homeless services are a scarce public resource and current allocation systems have not been thoroughly investigated. Algorithmic techniques excel at modeling complex interactions between features and therefore have potential to model effects of homeless services at the individual level. These models can reason counterfactually about the effects of different services on each household and resulting predictions can be used for matching households to services. The ability to model heterogeneity in treatment effects of services provides the potential for “precision public health” where allocation of services is based on data-driven predictions of which service will lead to better outcomes. I discuss the scarce resource allocation problem as it applies to homeless service delivery, and the ability to improve upon the current allocation system using algorithmic techniques. I compare prediction algorithms to each other as well as to the ability of the general public to make these decisions. As homeless services are scarce public goods, it is vital to ensure allocations are not only efficient, but fair and ethical. I discuss efforts to ensure fair decisions and to understand how people prioritize households who should receive scarce homeless services. I also discuss future work and next steps as well as policy implications.

**Talk Title:**Distribution-Free Assessment of Population Overlap in Observational Studies

**Talk Abstract:**Overlap in baseline covariates between treated and control groups, also known as positivity or common support, is one of the most fundamental assumptions in observational causal inference. Assessing this assumption is often ad hoc, however, and can give misleading results. For example, the common practice of examining the empirical distribution of estimated propensity scores is heavily dependent on model specification and has poor uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we propose a formal statistical framework for assessing the extrema of the population propensity score; e.g., the propensity score lies in [0.1, 0.9] almost surely. We develop a family of upper confidence bounds, which we term O-values, for this quantity. We show these bounds are valid in finite samples so long as the observations are independent and identically distributed, without requiring any further modeling assumptions on the data generating process. We also use extensive simulations to show that these bounds are reasonably tight in practice. Finally, we demonstrate this approach using several benchmark observational studies, showing how to build our proposed method into the observational causal inference workflow.

**Talk Title:**Optimization for Federated Learning

**Talk Abstract:**Optimization has been a vital tool for enabling the success of machine learning. In the recently introduced paradigm of federated learning, where devices or organizations unite to train a model without revealing their private data, optimization has been particularly nontrivial. The peculiarities of federated learning that make it difficult include unprecedented privacy constraints, the difficulty of communication with a server, and high heterogeneity of the data across the participating parties. Nevertheless, the potential applications of federated learning, such as machine learning for health care, banking, and smartphones, have sparked global interest in the problem and quick growth in the number of publications.

In this talk, we will discuss some of the recent advances in optimization for federated learning. We will formulate the key challenges in communication efficiency and personalization and propose ways for tackling them that are motivated by theory. To this end, we will discuss the convergence properties of some existing and new federated learning algorithms that leverage on-device (local) iterations as a way to limit communication.

**Talk Title:**Discrimination, Diversity, and Information in Selection Problems

**Talk Abstract:**Despite the large empirical literature on disparities in college admissions, our theoretical understanding is limited. In this talk, I will introduce a theoretical framework to study how a decision-maker concerned with both merit and diversity, selects candidate students under imperfect information, limited capacity, and legal constraints. Motivated by recent decisions to drop standardized testing in admissions, we apply this framework to study how information differences lead to disparities across equally skilled groups and quantify the trade-off between information and access in test-free and test-based policies with and without affirmative action. Using application and transcript data from the University of Texas at Austin, we illustrate that there exist practical settings where dropping standardized testing improves or worsens both merit and diversity. Furthermore, we extend this model to demonstrate how privilege differences lead to intra-group disparities and establish that the direction of discrimination at the observable level may differ from the unobservable level. We compare common policies used in practice and take an optimization approach to design an optimal policy under legal constraints.

**Talk Title:**Adapting to failure of the IID assumption for sequential prediction

**Talk Abstract:** We consider sequential prediction with expert advice when data are generated from distributions varying arbitrarily within an unknown constraint set. We quantify relaxations of the classical IID assumption in terms of these constraint sets, with IID sequences at one extreme and adversarial mechanisms at the other. The Hedge algorithm, long known to be minimax optimal in the adversarial regime, was recently shown to be minimax optimal for IID data. We show that Hedge with deterministic learning rates is suboptimal between these extremes, and present new algorithms that adaptively achieve the minimax optimal rate of regret with respect to our relaxations of the IID assumption, and do so without knowledge of the underlying constraint set. We analyze our algorithm using the follow-the-regularized-leader framework, and prove it corresponds to Hedge with adaptive learning rates.

**Talk Title:**Developing User-Centric Models for Question Answering

**Talk Abstract:**Everyday users now benefit from powerful QA technologies in a range of consumer-facing applications. Voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home have brought natural language technologies to several million homes globally. Yet, even with millions of users now interacting with these technologies on a daily basis, there has been surprisingly little research attention devoted to studying the issues that arise when people use QA systems. Traditional QA evaluations do not reflect the needs of many users who can benefit from QA technologies. For example, users with a range of visual and motor impairments would prefer the option to interact with voice interfaces for efficient text entry. Keeping these needs in mind, we construct evaluations considering the interfaces through which users interact with QA systems. We analyze and mitigate errors introduced by three interface types that could be connected to a QA engine: speech recognizers converting spoken queries to text, keyboards used to type queries into the system, and translation systems processing queries in other languages. Our experiments and insights present a useful starting point for both practitioners and researchers, to develop usable question-answering systems.

**Talk Title:**Deep Learning Frameworks for Epidemic Forecasting

**Talk Abstract:**Our vulnerability to emerging infectious diseases has been illustrated with the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Forecasting epidemic trajectories (such as future incidence over the next four weeks) gives policymakers a valuable input for designing effective healthcare policies and optimizing supply chain decisions. However, this is a non-trivial task with multiple open questions. In this talk, I will present our neural frameworks for epidemic forecasting, using seasonal influenza and the COVID-19 as examples. I will introduce our efforts in three research directions: (1) awareness of multiple facets of the epidemic dynamics, (2) coping with challenges from using public health data, and (3) readiness to provide actionable forecasts and insights. I will first discuss our deployed model for predicting COVID-associated indicators, which has been recognized as a top short-term forecasting model among all models submitting predictions to the CDC. I will also introduce how to use deep learning to adapt a historical flu model to an emerging scenario where COVID and flu coexist by leveraging auxiliary data sources. Next, I will introduce deep learning frameworks for incorporating expert-guidance, principled uncertainty quantification for well-calibrated forecasts, and handling data revisions for refining forecasts. Finally, I will share some future research directions.

**Talk Title:**Engaging Politically Diverse Audiences on Social Media

**Talk Abstract:**In this talk, I will present our study of how political polarization is reflected in the language used by media outlets to promote their content online and what we can do to reduce it. We tracked the Twitter posts of several media outlets over the course of more than three years (566K tweets), and the engagement with these tweets from other users (104M retweets). We then used this data to model the relationship between the tweet text and the political diversity of the audience. We built a tool that integrates our models and helps journalists craft tweets that are engaging to a politically diverse audience, guided by the model predictions. To test the real-world impact of the tool, we partnered with the award-winning PBS documentary series Frontline and ran a series of advertising experiments on Twitter testing how tens of thousands of users respond to the tweets. We found that in seven out of the ten experiments, the tweets selected by our model were indeed engaging to a more politically diverse audience, illustrating the effectiveness of our tool. I will close by discussing the methodological challenges and opportunities in using advertisements to test interventions on social media platforms.

**Talk Title:**Exploiting Prior Knowledge in Physical World Incorporated with Machine Learning for Solving Medical Imaging Problems

**Talk Abstract:**Medical imaging is crucial for image-guided clinical patient care. In my research of the interdisciplinary area in medical AI, I develop efficient machine learning algorithms for medical imaging by exploiting prior knowledge from the physical world — exploit what you know — to incorporate with machine learning models.

I present two main directions of my research. First, since the data-driven machine learning methods always suffer from limitations in generalizability, reliability and interpretability, By exploiting geometry and physics priors from the imaging system, I proposed physics-aware and geometry-informed deep learning frameworks for radiation-reduced sparse-view CT and accelerated MR imaging. Incorporating geometry and physics priors, the trained deep networks show more robust generalization across patients and better interpretability. Second, motivated by the unique characteristics of medical images that patients are often scanned serially over time during clinical treatment, where earlier images provide abundant prior knowledge of the patient’s anatomy, I proposed a prior embedding method to encode internal information of image priors through coordinate-based neural representation learning. Since this method requires no training data from external subjects, it relaxes the burden of data collection, and can be easily generalized across different imaging modalities and anatomies. Following this, I developed a novel algorithm of temporal neural representation learning for longitudinal study. Combining both physics priors and image priors, I showed proposed algorithm can successfully capture subtle yet significant structure changes such as tumor progression in sparse-sampling image reconstruction, which can be applied to tackle real-world challenges in cancer patients treatment and radiation therapy.

**Talk Title:**Safety-Critical Learning and Control in Dynamic Environments: Towards Unified Theory and Learned Robotic Agility

**Talk Abstract:**Deep-learning-based methods have made exciting progress in many decision-making problems such as playing complicated strategy games. However, for complex real-world settings, such as agile robotic control in hazardous or poorly-sensed environments (e.g., autonomous driving), end-to-end deep-learning-based methods are often unreliable. In this talk, I will first present the Neural-Control Family, which is a family of nonlinear deep-learning-based control methods with stability, safety, and robustness guarantees. The Neural-Control Family bridges learning and control theory in a unified framework, and demonstrates new capabilities in agile robot control (e.g., agile flight maneuvers in unknown strong wind conditions). In the second part, I will discuss progress towards establishing clean interfaces that fundamentally connect learning and control. A strong focus will be on non-asymptotic analysis for online learning and control. In particular, we will discuss the intersection of representation learning and adaptive control, no-regret and competitive control, and safe exploration in dynamical systems.

**Bio:**Tyler is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, advised by Kyle Chard and Ian Foster. His research interests lie at the intersection of data management, data science, and HPC, focusing on enabling scientists to maximize the utility of massive amounts of data. His work has culminated in the design of the open-source system Xtract that can intelligently formulate metadata extraction workflows for data stored in heterogeneous file formats across leadership-scale computing facilities. Before joining the University of Chicago, he received his B.A. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Macalester College.

**Talk Title:**Enabling Data Utility Across the Sciences

**Talk Abstract:** Scientific data repositories are generally chaotic—files spanning heterogeneous domains, studies, and users are stuffed into an increasingly-unsearchable data swamp without regard for organization, discoverability, or usability. Files that could contribute to scientists’ future research may be spread across storage facilities and submerged beneath petabytes of other files, rendering manual annotation and navigation virtually impossible. To remedy this lack of navigability, scientists require a rich search index of metadata, or data about data, extracted from individual files. In this talk, we will explore automated metadata extraction workflows for converting dark data swamps into navigable data collections, given no prior knowledge regarding each file’s schema or provenance. I enable such extraction from files of vastly different structures by building a robust suite of “extractors” that leverage data scientific methods (e.g., keyword analysis, entity recognition, and file type identification) in order to maximize our body of knowledge about a diversity of files.

In this talk, I outline the construction, optimization, and evaluation of Xtract—a scalable metadata extraction system—that automatically constructs extraction plans for files distributed across remote cyberinfrastructure. I illustrate the scale challenges in processing these data, and outline techniques to maximize extraction throughput, by analyzing Xtract’s performance on three real science data sets.

**Talk Title:**AI for Science: Learning from Experts and Data

**Talk Abstract:**In many fields, the amount of recorded scientific data is increasing much faster than the speed at which researchers can analyze and interpret them. For example, recorded videos of animal behavior over a few days can take domain experts months to analyze. Innovations in data science, such as machine learning, provide a promising direction to enable scientists to scalably perform data-driven experiments. However, scientific applications raise a number of challenges for existing methods: data creation is expensive, model interpretability is important, and tools are often needed to translate algorithmic improvements to practical benefits.

To address these challenges, my current work has focused on incorporating domain knowledge into machine learning to reduce human effort for data analysis. I will discuss methods to improve the sample-efficiency and interpretability of models in the context of behavior modeling. To learn annotation-sample efficient representations, we developed a framework to unify self-supervision with weak programmatic supervision from domain experts. We demonstrated that our method reduces annotation requirements up to a factor of 10 without compromising accuracy, compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, we investigate program synthesis as a promising direction to produce interpretable descriptions of behavior. We integrate interpretable programs from our method with an existing tool in behavioral neuroscience. These interdisciplinary approaches of machine learning with experts in the loop are important to broaden the application of data science across scientific domains.

His research interests are in online learning, algorithmic economics, optimization, and behavioral experiments, with a focus on developing theoretically rigorous, empirically grounded frameworks to understand and design human-centered algorithms. He received the B.E. degree from Tianjin University in 2017.

**Talk Title:**Learning with Understanding: Human Behavior in Algorithm Design

**Talk Abstract:** Algorithms increasingly pervade every sphere of human life and thus have great potential to reshape various sectors of our modern society. Thus, it is important to understand the role humans play in the design of algorithm. However, human involvement also creates unique challenges. Humans might be careless, strategic, or have behavioral biases.  
In this talk, I will present two works from my own research on theoretically and empirically dealing with these challenges when humans are involved in algorithm design. First, I will describe the problem on learning with human biased behavior. In this problem, the learner cannot directly observe the realized reward of an action but can only observe human biased feedback on the realized reward. I explored two natural human feedback models. Our results show that a small deviation on user behavior model and/or the design of the information structure could significant impact the overall system outcome.  
I then step back and examine whether the standard behavior models capture human behavior in practice by utilizing behavioral experiments. I studied this question in AI-assisted decision-making where AI intelligently abstracts out useful information from a large amount of data. Human then review the information output by the AI and make the decision. I have run behavior experiments to characterize human’s response in practice and established an empirically grounded human behavior model.

**Bio:**I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Machine Learning Foundations group at Microsoft Research Redmond. My research interests are in designing algorithms for massive datasets and large-scale machine learning, especially in the contexts of high-dimensional metric data, fast linear algebra, and learning on data streams. My recent work is focused on harnessing the power of big data and machine learning to guide us toward better algorithm design. I received my PhD from the EECS department at MIT in September 2020, and have spent time as a research intern at Microsoft, Amazon and VMware.

**Talk Title:**On the Role of Data in Algorithm Design

**Talk Abstract:**Recently, there has been a growing interest in harnessing the power of big datasets and modern machine learning for designing new scalable algorithms. This invites us to rethink the role of data in algorithm design: not just the input to pre-defined algorithms, but also a factor that enters the algorithm design process itself, driving it in a strong and possibly automated manner. In this talk, I will describe my work on data-driven and learning-based algorithms for high-dimensional metric spaces and nearest neighbor search. In particular, I will show that data-dependence is necessary for optimal compressed representations of high-dimensional Euclidean distances, and that neural networks can be used to build better data structures for nearest neighbor search.

**Talk Title:**Evaluating the Impact of Entity Resolution in Social Network Metrics

[Watch Abby’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBhoOKcPfAQ&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=11)

**Talk Abstract:** Modern databases are filled with potential duplicate entries—caused by misspellings, change in address, or differences in abbreviations. The probabilistic disambiguation of entries is often referred to as entity resolution.

Entity resolution of individuals (nodes) in relational datasets is often viewed as a pre-processing step in network analysis. Studies in bibliometrics have indicated that entity resolution changes network properties in citation networks, but little research has used real-world social networks that vary in size and type. We present a novel perspective on entity resolution in networks—where we propagate error from the entity resolution process into downstream network inferences. We also seek to understand how match thresholds in unsupervised entity resolution affect both global and local network properties, such as the degree distribution, centrality, transitivity, and motifs such as stars and triangles. We propose a calibration of these network metrics given measures of entity resolution quality, such as node “splitting” and “lumping” errors.

We use a respondent driven sample of people who use drugs (PWUD) in Appalachia and a longitudinal network study of Chicago-based young men who have sex with men (YMSM) to demonstrate the implications this has for social and public health policy.

**Bio:** Abby Smith is a Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics at Northwestern University. Her work centers around evaluating the impact of entity resolution error in social network inferences. She is particularly interested in collaborative research and data science for social good applications, and most recently served as a Solve for Good consultant at the mHealth nonprofit Medic Mobile. Abby is passionate about building community for women in statistics and data science in Chicago, and serves as a WiDS Ambassador and R-Ladies: Chicago board member. She holds a Masters in Statistical Practice and a B.S. in Mathematics, both from Carnegie Mellon.

**Talk Title:** Modeling the Impact of Social Determinants of Health on Covid-19 Transmission and Mortality to Understand Health Inequities

[Watch Abby’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLQ1kX6UYY8&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=9)

**Talk Abstract:** The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted drastic health inequities, particularly in cities such as Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, and New York City. Reducing Covid-19 morbidity and mortality will likely require an increased focus on social determinants of health, given their disproportionate impact on populations most heavily affected by Covid-19. A better understanding of how factors such as household income, housing location, health care access, and incarceration contribute to Covid-19 transmission and mortality is needed to inform policies around social distancing and testing and vaccination scale-up.

This work builds upon an existing agent-based model of Covid-19 transmission in Chicago, CityCOVID. CityCOVID consists of a synthetic population that is statistically representative of Chicago’s population (2.7 million persons), along with their associated places (1.4 million places) and behaviors (13,000 activity schedules). During a simulated day, agents move from place-to-place, hour-by-hour, engaging in social activities and interactions with other colocated agents, resulting in an endogenous colocation or contact network. Covid-19 transmission is determined via a simulated epidemiological model based on this generated contact network by tuning (fitting) model parameters that result in simulation output that matches observed Covid-19 death and hospitalization data from the City of Chicago. Using the CityCOVID infrastructure, we quantify the impact of social determinants of health on Covid-19 transmission dynamics by applying statistical techniques to empirical data to study the relationship between social determinants of health and Covid-19 outcomes.

**Bio:** Abby Stevens is fourth year statistics PhD student at the University of Chicago advised by Rebecca Willett. She is interested in using data science techniques to address important social and political issues, such as climate science, public health, and algorithmic fairness. She graduated with a math degree from Grinnell College in 2014 and then worked as a data scientist at a healthcare tech company before entering graduate school. She has been involved in a number of data science for social good organizations and is a primary organizer of the Women in Data Science Chicago annual event.

**Talk Title:** Covariant Neural Networks for Physics Applications

[Watch Alexander’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTWfe_vuSc&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=2)

**Talk Abstract:** Most traditional neural network architectures do not respect any intrinsic structure of the input data, and instead are expect to “learn” it. CNNs are the first widespread example of a symmetry, in this case the translational symmetry of images, being used to advise much more efficient and transparent network architectures. More recently, CNNs were generalized to other non-commutative symmetry groups such as SO(3). However, in physics application one is more likely to encounter input data that belong to linear representations of Lie Groups, as opposed to being functions (or “images”) on a symmetric space of the group.

To deal with such problems, I will present a general feed-forward architecture that takes vectors as inputs, works entirely in the Fourier space of the symmetry group, and is fully covariant. This approach allows one to achieve equal performance with drastically fewer learnable parameters, Moreover, the models become much more physically meaningful and more likely to be interpretable. My application of choice is in particle physics, where the main symmetry is the 6-dimensional Lorentz group. I will demonstrate the success of covariant architectures compared to more conventional approaches.

**Bio:** I am a PhD student at the University of Chicago working on theoretical hydrodynamics problems in relation to the quantum Hall effect. In addition, I am working on developing new group-covariant machine learning tools for physics applications, such as Lorentz-covariant neural networks for particle physics. My background is in mathematical physics, in which I hold a master’s degree from the Saint-Petersburg University in Russia. My interests lie on the intersection of theoretical and mathematical physics and new inter-disciplinary applications of such ideas.

**Talk Title:** Credible and Effective Data-Driven Decision-Making: Minimax Policy Learning under Unobserved Confounding

**Talk Abstract:** We study the problem of learning causal-effect maximizing personalized decision policies from observational data while accounting for possible unobserved confounding. Since policy value and regret may not be point-identifiable, we study a method that minimizes the worst-case estimated regret over an uncertainty set for propensity weights that controls the extent of unobserved confounding. We prove generalization guarantees that ensure our policy will be safe when applied in practice and will in fact obtain the best-possible uniform control on the range of all possible population regrets that agree with the possible extent of confounding. Finally, we assess and compare our methods on synthetic and semi-synthetic data. In particular, we consider a case study on personalizing hormone replacement therapy based on the parallel WHI observational study and clinical trial. We demonstrate that hidden confounding can hinder existing policy learning approaches and lead to unwarranted harm, while our robust approach guarantees safety and focuses on well-evidenced improvement.  This work is joint with Nathan Kallus.

[Watch Bryan’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffiAO_ufWB8&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=12)

**Talk Abstract:** As exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, our health and wellbeing depend on a difficult-to-measure web of societal factors and individual behaviors. Tackling social challenges with AI requires algorithmic and data-driven paradigms which span the full process of gathering costly data, learning models to understand and predict interactions, and optimizing the use of limited resources in interventions. This talk presents methodological developments at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and social networks which are motivated by on-the-ground collaborations on HIV prevention, tuberculosis treatment, and the COVID-19 response. These projects have produced deployed applications and policy impact. For example, I will present the development of an AI-augmented intervention for HIV prevention among homeless youth. This system was evaluated in a field test enrolling over 700 youth and found to significantly reduce key risk behaviors for HIV.

**Talk Title:**Towards Data-Driven Internet Routing Security

**Talk Abstract:** The Internet ecosystem is critical for the reliability of online daily life. However, key Internet protocols, such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), were not designed to cope with untrustworthy parties, making them vulnerable to misconfigurations and attacks from anywhere in the network. In this talk, I will present an evidence-based data-driven approach to improve routing infrastructure security, which I use to identify and characterize BGP serial hijackers, networks that persistently hijack IP address blocks in BGP. I’ll also show how similar approaches can quantify the benefits of the RPKI security framework against prefix hijacks, and identify route leaks. This work improves our understanding about how our Internet actually works and has been used by industry and researchers for network reputation and monitoring of operational security practices.

**Talk Title:**Machine Learning for Astrophysics & Cosmology in the Era of Large Astronomical Surveys and an Application for the Discovery and Classification of Faint Galaxies

[Watch Dimitrios’ Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA2zFsspsJ4&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=10)

**Talk Abstract:** Observational astrophysics & cosmology are entering the era of big-data. Future astronomical surveys are expected to collect hundreds of petabytes of data and detect billions of objects. Machine learning will play an important role in the analysis of these surveys with the potential to revolutionize astronomy, as well as providing challenging problems that can give opportunities for breakthroughs in the fundamental understanding of machine learning  
In this talk I will present the discovery of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. LBGSs are galaxies with intrinsic brightness less than that of the dark sky, and so are hard to detect and study. At the same time, they are expected to dominate the number density of galaxies in the universe, which thus remains relatively unexplored. I will discuss the development of automated, deep learning-based, pipelines for LSBG detection (separation of LSB galaxies from LSB artifacts present in images) and morphological classification. Such techniques will be extremely valuable in the advent of very large future surveys like the planned Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

**Talk Title:** Network Effects on Outcomes and Unequal Distribution of Resources

[Watch Eaman’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxs5qN0JObg&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=5)

**Talk Abstract:**We study how networks affect different groups differently and provide pathways to reinforce existing inequalities. First we provide observational evidence for differential network advantages in access to information: individuals from the low status group receive lower marginal benefit from networking than the high status group. Second, we provide causal evidence for differential diffusion of a new behavior in the network, mainly driven due to homophily and slight initial advantages of a group. Third, we develop a theoretical network model that captures the network structure of unequal access to opportunities. We show that any departure from the uniform distribution of links to information sources among members of a group limits the diffusion of information to the group as a whole. Fourth, we develop an online lab experiment to further study the network mechanisms that widen inter-group differences and yield different returns on social capital to different groups. We recruit individuals to play an online collaborative game in which they have to find and dig gold mines and in the process can pass information to their network neighbors. By changing the network structure and composition of groups with low and high initial advantage, we generate the processes that lead to unequal distribution of opportunities, beyond what’s expected by individual differences. Finally, we contribute to the literature on network structure and performance and propose the concept of bandwidth-diversity matching: individuals who match the tie strength to their contacts with their information novelty achieve truly diverse networks and better outcomes.

**Bio:**I am a PhD candidate in the Social and Engineering Systems program at MIT IDSS, under supervision of Prof. Pentland and Prof. Eckles. I am also receiving a second PhD in Statistics from the Statistics and Data Science Center at MIT.

As a computational social scientist, I use methods from network science, statistics, experiment design and causal inference. I am also interested in understanding the collective behavior in institutional settings, the institutional mechanisms that promote cooperative behavior in networks, or in contrast lead to unequal outcomes for different groups.  
In a previous life, I worked at Google New York City as a software engineer from 2011 to 2015. Currently, I am also a research contractor at Facebook working on how networks affect economic outcomes.

**Talk Title:**What and How Students Read: A Data-driven Insight

**Talk Abstract:**Reading is an integral part of learning. The purpose of reading to learn is to comprehend meaning from informational texts. Reading comprehension tasks require self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviors – to plan, monitor, and evaluate one’s reading strategies. Students without SRL skills may struggle in reading which in turn may inhibit them to acquire domain-specific knowledge. Thus, understanding students reading behavior and SRL usage is important for intervention. Digital reading platforms can provide opportunities to learn and practice SRL strategies in classroom settings. These platforms log rich array of student and teacher interaction data with the systems. Retrospective analysis of these logged data can derive insights– which can be used to support tailored interventions by instructors and students in complex learning activities. In this talk, I will discuss students’ science reading and SRL behaviors, and connect those behaviors with performance within a digital literacy platform, Actively Learn. The talk consists of two studies (i) identifying patterns that differ between productive and unproductive students (iI) analyzing the association of teachers’ behavior and students’ SRL usage. I will finish my talk by underlying possible future directions.

**Talk Title:** Quantifying The Power of Mental Shortcuts in Persuasive Communication with Causal Inference from Text

**Talk Abstract:** The reliance of individuals on mental shortcuts based on factors such as gender, affiliation, and social status could distort the equitability of interpersonal discussions in various settings. Yet, the impact of such shortcuts in real-world discussions remains challenging to quantify. In this talk, I propose a novel quasi-experimental study that incorporates unstructured text in a principled manner to quantify the causal effect of status indicators in persuasive communication. I also examine how linguistic and rhetorical devices moderate this effect, and thus provide communication strategies to potentially reduce individuals’ reliance on mental shortcuts. I discuss implications for fair communication policies both within organizations and in society at large.

**Talk Title:**Machine Learning in Dynamical Systems

**Talk Abstract:**Many branches of science and engineering involve estimation and control in dynamical systems; consider, for example, using data to help stabilize the flight of a drone or predict the path of a hurricane. We consider control in dynamical systems from the perspective of regret minimization. Unlike most prior work in this area, we focus on the problem of designing an online controller which competes with the best dynamic sequence of control actions selected in hindsight, instead of the best controller in some specific class of controllers. This formulation is attractive when the environment changes over time and no single controller achieves good performance over the entire time horizon. We derive the structure of the regret-optimal online controller using techniques from robust control theory and present a clean data-dependent bound on its regret. We also present numerical simulations which confirm that our regret-optimal controller significantly outperforms various classical controllers in dynamic environments.

**Talk Title:**Adversarial Collusion on the Web: State-of-the-art and Future Directions

**Talk Abstract:**The growth and popularity of online media have made it the most important platform for collaboration and communication among its users. Given its tremendous growth, the social reputation of an entity in online media plays an important role. This has led to users choosing artificial ways to gain social reputation by means of blackmarket services as the natural way to boost social reputation is time-consuming. We refer to such artificial ways of boosting social reputation as collusion. In this talk, we will comprehensively review recent developments in analyzing and detecting collusive entities on online media. First, we give an overview of the problem and motivate the need to detect these entities. Second, we survey the state-of-the-art models that range from designing feature-based methods to more complex models, such as using deep learning architectures and advanced graph concepts. Third, we detail the annotation guidelines, provide a description of tools/applications and explain the publicly available datasets. The talk concludes with a discussion of future trends.

**Talk Title:**Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Thoracic CT Scans Through Multiple Instance Transfer Learning

**Talk Abstract:**Computer-aided diagnosis systems have demonstrated significant potential in improving patient care and clinical outcomes by providing more extensive information to clinicians.  The development of these systems typically requires a large amount of well-annotated data, which can be challenging to acquire in medical imaging.  Several techniques have been investigated in an attempt to overcome insufficient data, including transfer learning, or the application of a pre-trained model to a new domain and/or task.  The successful translation of transfer learning models to complex medical imaging problems holds significant potential and could lead to widespread clinical implementation.

However, transfer learning techniques often fail translate effectively because they are limited by the domain in which they were initially trained.  For example, computed tomography (CT) is a powerful medical imaging modality that leverages 3D images in clinical decision-making, but transfer learning models are typically trained on 2D images and thus can not incorporate the additional information provided by the third dimension.  This evaluation of the available data in a CT scan is inefficient and potentially does not effectively improve clinical decisions.  In this project, the 3D information available in CT scans is combined incorporated with transfer learning through a multiple instance learning (MIL) scheme, which can individually assess 2D images and form a collective 3D prediction based on the 2D information, similar to how a radiologist would read a CT scan.  This approach has been applied to evaluate both COVID-19 and emphysema in CT thoracic CT scans and demonstrated strong clinical potential.

**Bio:**Jordan Fuhrman is a student in the Graduate Program in Medical Physics at the University of Chicago.

His work has largely focused on incidental disease assessment in low-dose CT lung screening scans, including emphysema, osteoporosis, and coronary artery calcifications, but has also included non-screening scan assessments of hypoxic ischemic brain injury and COVID-19. Jordan is a student member of both the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and the Society of Photo-optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

**Talk Title:**How to Preserve Privacy in Data Analysis?

**Talk Abstract:**The past decade has witnessed the tremendous success of large-scale data science. However, recent studies show that many existing powerful machine learning tools used in large-scale data science pose severe threats to personal privacy. Therefore, one of the major challenges in data analysis is how to learn effectively from the enormous amounts of sensitive data without giving up on privacy. Differential Privacy (DP) has recently emerged as a new gold standard for private data analysis due to the statistical data privacy it can provide for sensitive information. Nevertheless, the adaptation of DP to data analysis remains challenging due to the complex models we often encountered in data analysis. In this talk, I will focus on two commonly used models, i.e., the centralized and distributed/federated models, for differentially private data analysis. For the centralized model, I will present my efforts to provide strong privacy and utility guarantees in high-dimensional data analysis. For the distributed/federated model, I will discuss new efficient and effective privacy-preserving learning algorithms.

**Talk Title:**Systematic Evaluation of Privacy Risks of Machine Learning Models

**Talk Abstract:**Machine learning models are prone to memorizing sensitive data, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks in which an adversary aims to guess if an input sample was used to train the model. In this talk, we show that prior work on membership inference attacks may severely underestimate the privacy risks by relying solely on training custom neural network classifiers to perform attacks and focusing only on aggregate results over data samples, such as the attack accuracy.

To overcome these limitations, we first propose to benchmark membership inference privacy risks by improving existing non-neural network based inference attacks and proposing a new inference attack method based on a modification of prediction entropy. Using our benchmark attacks, we demonstrate that existing membership inference defense approaches are not as effective as previously reported.

Next, we introduce a new approach for fine-grained privacy analysis by formulating and deriving a new metric called the privacy risk score. Our privacy risk score metric measures an individual sample’s likelihood of being a training member, which allows an adversary to perform membership inference attacks with high confidence. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the privacy risk score metric and demonstrate the distribution of privacy risk scores across individual samples is heterogeneous. Our work emphasizes the importance of a systematic and rigorous evaluation of privacy risks of machine learning models.

**Talk Title:** Reasoning about Social Dynamics and Social Bias in Language

[Watch Maarten’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHIEl01UFss&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=8)

**Talk Abstract:** Humans easily make inferences to reason about the social and power dynamics of situations (e.g., stories about everyday interactions), but such reasoning is still a challenge for modern NLP systems. In this talk, I will address how we can make machines reason about social commonsense and social biases in text, and how this reasoning could be applied in downstream applications.

In the first part, I will discuss PowerTransformer, our new unsupervised model for controllable debiasing of text through the lens of connotation frames of power and agency. Trained using a combined reconstruction and paraphrasing objective, this model can rewrite story sentences such that its characters are portrayed with more agency and decisiveness. After establishing its performance through automatic and human evaluations, we show how PowerTransformer can be used to mitigate gender bias in portrayals of movie characters. Then, I will introduce Social Bias Frames, a conceptual formalism that models the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others to reason about biased or harmful implications in language. Using a new corpus of 150k structured annotations, we show that models can learn to reason about high-level offensiveness of statements, but struggle to explain why a statement might be harmful. I will conclude with future directions for better reasoning about social dynamics and social biases.

**Bio:** Maarten Sap is a final year PhD student in the University of Washington’s natural language processing (NLP) group, advised by Noah Smith and Yejin Choi.

**Talk Title:**Formal Logic Enhanced Deep Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems

[Watch Meiyi’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd8MP6va1i4&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=6)

**Talk Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks are broadly applied and have outstanding achievements for prediction and decision-making support for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). However, for large-scale and complex integrated CPS with high uncertainties, DNN models are not always robust, often subject to anomalies, and subject to erroneous predictions, especially when the predictions are projected into the future (uncertainty and errors grow over time). To increase the robustness of DNNs for CPS, in my work, I developed a novel formal logic enhanced learning framework with logic-based criteria to enhance DNN models to follow system critical properties and build well-calibrated uncertainty estimation models. Trained in an end-to-end manner with back-propagation, this framework is general and can be applied to various DNN models. The evaluation results on large-scale real-world city datasets show that my work not only improves the accuracy of predictions and effectiveness of uncertainty estimation, but importantly also guarantees the satisfaction of model properties and increases the robustness of DNNs. This work can be applied to a wide spectrum of applications, including the Internet of Things, smart cities, healthcare, and many others.

**Talk Title:**Human-AI Collaborative Decision Making on Rehabilitation Assessment

**Talk Abstract:**Rehabilitation monitoring systems with sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) provide an opportunity to improve current rehabilitation practices by automatically collecting quantitative data on patient’s status. However, the adoption of these systems still remains a challenge. This paper presents an interactive AI-based system that supports collaborative decision making with therapists for rehabilitation assessment. This system automatically identifies salient features of assessment to generate patient-specific analysis for therapists, and tunes with their feedback. In two evaluations with therapists, we found that our system supports therapists significantly higher agreement on assessment (0.71 average F1-score) than a traditional system without analysis (0.66 average F1-score, p < 0.05). In addition, after tuning with therapist’s feedback, our system significantly improves its performance (from 0.8377 to 0.9116 average F1-scores, p < 0.01). This work discusses the potential of a human and AI collaborative system that supports more accurate decision making while learning from each other’s strengths.

**Talk Title:**Mathematical Models of Brain Connectivity and Behavior: Network Optimization Perspectives, Deep-Generative Hybrids, and Beyond

**Talk Abstract:**Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple impairments and levels of disability that vary widely across the ASD spectrum. Currently, quantifying symptom severity relies almost solely on a trained clinician’s evaluation. Recently, neuroimaging studies, for example, using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) have been gaining popularity for studying brain dysfunction. My work aims at linking the symptomatic characterization of ASD with the functional and structural organization of a patient’s brain via machine learning. To set the stage, I will first introduce a joint network optimization to predict clinical severity from rs-fMRI data. Our model is couples two terms: a generative matrix factorization and a discriminative regression in a joint optimization. Next, we extend this to a deep-generative hybrid, that jointly models the complementarity between structure (DTI) and functional dynamics (dynamic rs-fMRI connectivity) to extract predictive disease biomarkers. The generative part of our framework is now a structurally-regularized matrix factorization on dynamic rs-fMRI correlation matrices, guided by DTI tractography to learn anatomically informed connectivity profiles. The deep part of our framework is an LSTM-ANN, which models the temporal evolution of the scan to map to behavior. Our main novelty lies in our coupled optimization, which collectively estimates the matrix factors and the neural network weights. We outperform several state-of-the-art baselines to extract multi-modal neural signatures of brain dysfunction. Finally, I will present our current exploration based on graph neural networks and manifold learning to better capture the underlying data geometry.

**Talk Title:**Power Outage Risk Interconnection: Relationship with Social and Environmental Critical Risk Indicators

[Watch Olukunle’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0relBaBHabw&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=7)

**Talk Abstract:**The interconnections between diverse components in a system can provide profound insights on the health and risk states of the system as a whole. Highly interconnected systems tend to accumulate risks until a large, systemic crisis hits. For example, in the 2007-09 financial crisis, the interconnection of financial institutions heightened near the collapse, suggesting the system could no longer absorb risks. Extending concepts of interconnectedness and systemic risk to coupled human-natural systems, one might expect similar behaviours of risk accumulation and heightened connectivity, leading to potential system failures. The Predictive Risk Investigation System (PRISM) for Multi-layer Dynamic Interconnection Analysis aims to explore the complex interconnectedness and systemic risks in human-natural systems.

Applying the PRISM approach, we could uncover dynamic relationships and trends in climate resilience and preparedness using Energy, Environmental and Social indicators. This study proposes a case-study application of the PRISM approach to the State of Massachusetts using a dataset of over 130000 power outages in the state from 2013-2018. Random Forest, Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMS) are applied to understand the interconnections between Power outages, Population density and Environmental factors (Weather indicators e.g. Wind Speed, Precipitation).

**Talk Abstract:**Optimization lies at the heart of modern machine learning and data science research. How to design data-efficient optimization algorithms that have a low sample complexity while enjoying a fast convergence at the same time has remained a challenging but imperative topic in machine learning.

In this talk, I will introduce our recent work in developing and improving data-efficient optimization algorithms for decision-making (reinforcement learning) problems. In particular, I will introduce the variance reduction technique in optimization and show how it can improve the data efficiency of policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning. I will present the variance reduced policy gradient algorithm, which constructs an unbiased policy gradient estimator for the value function. I will show that it provably reduces the sample complexity of vanilla policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GPOMDP.

**Talk Title:** Efficient Neural Question Answering for Heterogeneous Platforms

[Watch Qingqing’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45PgiWIBo3s&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=3)

**Talk Abstract:** Natural language processing (NLP) systems power many real-world applications like Alexa, Siri, or Google and Bing. Deep learning NLP systems are becoming more effective due to increasingly larger models with multiple layers and millions to billions of parameters. It is challenging to deploy these systems because they are compute-intensive, consume much more energy, and cannot run on mobile devices. In this talk, I will present two works on optimizing efficiency in question answering systems and my current research in studying large NLP models’ energy consumption. First, I will introduce DeQA, which provides an on-device question-answering capability to help mobile users find information more efficiently without privacy issues. Deep learning based QA systems are slow and unusable on mobile devices. We design the latency- and memory- optimizations widely applicable for state-of-the-art QA systems to run locally on mobile devices. Second, I will present DeFormer, a simple decomposition-based technique that takes pre-trained Transformer models and modifies them to enable faster inference for QA for both the cloud and mobile. Lastly, I will introduce how we can accurately measure the energy consumption of NLP models using hardware power meters and build reliable energy estimation models by abstracting meaningful features of the NLP workloads and profiling runtime resource usage.

**Talk Title:**Artificial Intelligence for Medical Image Analysis for Breast Cancer Multiparametric MRI

[Watch Isabelle’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJYjES0kSzw&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=4)

**Talk Abstract:**Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in medical imaging. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems using human-engineered features or deep learning can potentially assist radiologists in image interpretation by extracting quantitative biomarkers to improve diagnostic performance and circumvent unnecessary invasive procedures. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become a part of routine clinical assessment for screening of high-risk patients for breast cancer and monitoring therapy response because it has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy. Current CADx methods for breast lesion assessment on MRI, however, are mostly focused on one sequence, the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. Therefore, we investigated methods for incorporating three sequences in mpMRI to improve the CADx performance in differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions. We compared integrating the mpMRI information at the image level, feature level, or classifier output level. In addition, transfer learning is often employed in deep learning applications in medical imaging due to data scarcity. However, pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in transfer learning require two-dimensional (2D) inputs, limiting the ability to utilize high-dimensional information in medical imaging. To address this problem, we investigated a transfer learning method that collapses volumetric information to 2D by taking the maximum intensity projection (MIP) at the feature level within CNNs, which outperformed a previous method of using MIPs of images themselves in the task of distinguishing between benign and malignant breast lesions. We proposed a method that combines feature fusion and feature MIP for computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis using high-dimensional mpMRI that outperforms the current benchmarks.

**Bio:**Isabelle is a PhD candidate in Medical Physics at the University of Chicago, supervised by Dr. Maryellen Giger. Her research is centered around developing automated methods for quantitative medical image analysis to assist in clinical decision-making. She has proposed novel methodologies to diagnoses breast cancer using multiparametric MRI exams. Since the pandemic, she has also been working on AI solutions that leverage medical images to enhance the early detection and prognosis of COVID-19. She has first-hand experience tackling unique challenges faced by medical imaging applications of machine learning due to high-dimensionality, data scarcity, noisy labels, etc. She loves working at the intersection of physics, medicine, and data science, and she is motivated by the profound potential impact that her research can bring on improving access to high-quality care and providing a proactive healthcare system. She hopes to dedicate her career to building AI-empowered technology to transform healthcare, accelerate scientific discoveries, and improving human well-being.

**Talk Title:**Asymptotically Optimal Exact Minibatch Metropolis-Hastings

**Talk Abstract:**Metropolis-Hastings (MH) is one of the most fundamental Bayesian inference algorithms, but it can be intractable on large datasets due to requiring computations over the whole dataset. In this talk, I will discuss minibatch MH methods, which use subsamples to enable scaling. First, I will talk about existing minibatch MH methods, and demonstrate that inexact methods (i.e. they may change the target distribution) can cause arbitrarily large errors in inference. Then, I will introduce a new exact minibatch MH method, TunaMH, which exposes a tunable trade-off between its batch size and its theoretically guaranteed convergence rate. Finally, I will present a lower bound on the batch size that any minibatch MH method must use to retain exactness while guaranteeing fast convergence—the first such bound for minibatch MH—and show TunaMH is asymptotically optimal in terms of the batch size.

**Bio:**Ruqi Zhang is a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at Cornell University, advised by Professor Chris De Sa.

**Talk Title:**Towards Global-Scale Biodiversity Monitoring – Scaling Geospatial and Taxonomic Coverage Using Contextual Clues

[Watch Sara’s Research Lightning Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwYnwEfkzDo&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=1)

**Talk Abstract:**Biodiversity is declining globally at unprecedented rates. We need to monitor species in real time and in greater detail to quickly understand which conservation efforts are most effective and take corrective action. Current ecological monitoring systems generate data far faster than researchers can analyze it, making scaling up impossible without automated data processing. However, ecological data collected in the field presents a number of challenges that current methods, like deep learning, are not designed to tackle. Biodiversity data is correlated in time and space, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to new sensor deployments. Environmental monitoring sensors have limited intelligence, resulting in objects of interest that are often too close/far, blurry, or in clutter. Further, the distribution of species is long-tailed, which results in highly-imbalanced datasets. These challenges are not unique to the natural world, advances in any one of these areas will have far-reaching impact across domains. To address these challenges, we take inspiration from the value of additional contextual information for human experts, and seek to incorporate it within the structure of machine learning systems. Incorporating species distributions and access across data collected within a sensor at inference time can improve generalization to new sensors without additional human data labeling. Going beyond single sensor deployment, there is a large degree of contextual information shared across multiple data streams. Our long-term goal is to develop learning methods that efficiently and adaptively benefit from many different data streams on a global scale.

**Bio:**Sara Beery has always been passionate about the natural world, and she saw a need for technology-based approaches to conservation and sustainability challenges. This led her to pursue a PhD at Caltech, where she is advised by Pietro Perona and funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, a PIMCO Fellowship in Data Science, and an Amazon/Caltech AI4Science Fellowship. Her research focuses on computer vision for global-scale biodiversity monitoring. She works closely with Microsoft AI for Earth and Google Research to translate her work into usable tools, including widely-used models and benchmarks for detection and recognition of animal species in challenging camera trap data at a global scale. She has worked to bridge the interdisciplinary gap between ecology and computer science by hosting the iWild-Cam challenge at the FGVC Workshop at CVPR from 2018-2021, and through founding and managing a highly successful AI for Conservation slack channel which provides a meeting point for experts from each community to discuss new methods and best practices for conservation technology. Sara’s prior experience as a professional ballerina and a nontraditional student has taught her the value of unique and diverse perspectives in the research community. She’s passionate about increasing diversity and inclusion in STEM through mentorship and outreach.

**Talk Title:**Promoting Worker Performance with Human-Centered Data Science

[Watch Teng’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmetpdVsTH4&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=13)

**Talk Abstract:**Addressing real-world problems about human behavior is one of the main approaches where advances in data science techniques and social science theories achieve the greatest social impact. To approach these problems, we propose a human-centered data science framework that synergizes strengths across machine learning, causal inference, field experiment, and social science theories to understand, predict, and intervene in human behavior. In this talk, I will present three empirical studies that promote worker performance with human-centered data science. In the first project, we work with New York City’s Mayor’s Office and deploy explainable machine learning models to predict the risk of tenant harassment in New York City. In the second project, we leverage insights from social identity theory and conduct a large-scale field experiment on DiDi, a leading ride-sharing platform, showing that the intervention of bonus-free team ranking/contest systems can improve driver engagement. Third, to further unpack the effect of team contests on individual DiDi drivers, we bring together causal inference, machine learning, and social science theories to predict individual treatment effects. Insights from this study are directionally actionable to improve team recommender systems and contest design. More promising future directions will be discussed to showcase the effectiveness and flexibility of this framework.

**Bio:**I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with Professor Qiaozhu Mei. My research focuses on human-centered data science, where I couple data science techniques and social science theories to address real-world problems by understanding, predicting, and intervening in human behavior.

Specifically, I synergize strengths across machine learning, causal inference, field experiments, and social science theories to solve practical problems in the areas of data science for social good, the sharing economy, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, social media, and health. For example, we have collaborated with the New York City’s Mayor’s Office and helped to prioritize government outreach to tenants vulnerable to landlord harassment in New York City by deploying machine learning models. In collaboration with Didi Chuxing, a leading ride-sharing platform, we have leveraged field experiments and machine learning models to enhance driver engagement and intervention design. The results of my work have been integrated into the real-world products that involve millions of users and have been published across data mining, social computing, and human-computer interaction venues.

**Talk Title:**PAPRIKA: Private Online False Discovery Rate Control

[Watch Wanrong’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWPaBShyJ2o&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=15)

**Talk Abstract:**In hypothesis testing, a false discovery occurs when a hypothesis is incorrectly rejected due to noise in the sample. When adaptively testing multiple hypotheses, the probability of a false discovery increases as more tests are performed. Thus the problem of False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is to find a procedure for testing multiple hypotheses that accounts for this effect in determining the set of hypotheses to reject. The goal is to minimize the number (or fraction) of false discoveries, while maintaining a high true positive rate (i.e., correct discoveries).  
In this work, we study False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in multiple hypothesis testing under the constraint of differential privacy for the sample. Unlike previous work in this direction, we focus on the online setting, meaning that a decision about each hypothesis must be made immediately after the test is performed, rather than waiting for the output of all tests as in the offline setting. We provide new private algorithms based on state-of-the-art results in non-private online FDR control. Our algorithms have strong provable guarantees for privacy and statistical performance as measured by FDR and power. We also provide experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in a variety of data environments.

**Bio:**Wanrong Zhang is a PhD candidate at Georgia Tech supervised by Rachel Cummings and Yajun Mei. Her research interests lie primarily in data privacy, with connections to statistics and machine learning. Her research focuses on designing privacy-preserving algorithms for machine learning models and statistical analysis tools, as well as identifying and preventing privacy vulnerabilities in modern collaborative learning. Before joining Georgia Tech, she received her B.S. in Statistics from Peking University.

[Watch Xinya’s Spotlight Research Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33_HriGigKQ&list=PL0IrIAIuK93H0cbSgTHNEroKJTamJMuGV&index=16)

**Talk Abstract:**Large amounts of text are written and published daily on-line. As a result, applications such as reading through the document to automatically extract useful information, and answering user questions have become increasingly needed for people’s efﬁcient absorption of information. In this talk, I will focus on the problem of finding and organizing information about events and introduce my recent research on document-level event extraction. Firstly, I’ll briefly summarize the high-level goal and several key challenges (including modeling context and better leveraging background knowledge), as well as my efforts to tackle them. Then I will focus on the work where we formulate event extraction as a question answering problem — both to access relevant knowledge encoded in large models and to reduce the cost of human annotation required for training data creation/construction.

**Bio:** Xinya Du is a Ph.D. candidate at the Computer Science Department of Cornell University, advised by Prof. Claire Cardie. He received a bachelor degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

**Talk Title:**Understanding Success and Failure in Science and Technology

**Talk Abstract:**The 21st century society is largely driven by science and innovation, but our quantitative understanding of why, how, and when innovators and innovations succeed or fail remains limited. Despite the long-standing interest in this topic, current science of science research relies on citation and publication records as its major data sources. Yet science functions as a complex system that is much more than published papers, and ignorance of this multidimensional nature precludes a deeper examination of many fundamental elements of innovation lifecycles, from failure to scientific breakthrough, from public funding to broad impact. In this talk, I will touch on a few examples of success and failure across science and technology, hoping to illustrate a way for a better understating of the full innovation lifecycle. By combining various large-scale datasets and interdisciplinary analytical frameworks rooted in data mining, statistical physics, and computational social science, we discover a series of fundamental mechanisms and signals underlying the processes in which (1) individuals and organizations build on previous repeated failures towards ultimate victory or defeat in science, startups and security; (2) scientific elites produce breakthrough discoveries in their scientific careers; and (3) scientific research gets funded and used by the general public. The uncovered patterns in these studies not only unveil regularity and predictability underlying the often-noisy social systems, they also offer a new theoretical and empirical basis that is practically relevant for individual scientists, research institutes, and innovation policymakers.

**Bio:**Yian Yin is a Ph.D. candidate of Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences at Northwestern University, advised by Dashun Wang and Noshir Contractor. He also holds affiliations with Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems and Center for Science of Science and Innovation. Prior to joining Northwestern, he received his bachelor degrees in Statistics and Economics from Peking University in 2016.

Yian studies computational social science, with a particular focus on integrating theoretical insights in innovation studies, computational tools in data science, and modeling frameworks in complex systems to examine various fundamental elements of innovation lifecycles, from dynamics of failure to emergence of scientific breakthrough, from public funding for science to broad uses of science in public domains. His research has been published in multidisciplinary journals including Science, Nature, Nature Human Behaviour, and Nature Reviews Physics, and has been featured in Science, Lancet, Forbes, Washington Post, Scientific American, Harvard Business Review, MIT Technology Review, among other outlets.

**Talk Title:**Towards Interpretable Machine Learning by Human Knowledge Reasoning

**Talk Abstract:**Given the great success achieved by statistical learning theories for building intelligent systems, there is still a long-standing challenge of artificial intelligence, which is to bridge the gaps between what machines know, what humans think what machines know, and what humans know, about the real world. By doing so, we are expected to ground the prior knowledge of machines to human knowledge first and perform explicit reasoning for various downstream tasks for better interpretable machine learning. 

In this talk, I will briefly present two pieces of my existing work that leverage human expert and commonsense knowledge reasoning to increase the interpretability and transparency of machine learning models in the field of natural language processing. Firstly, I will show how existing cognitive theories on human memory can inspire an interpretable framework for rationalizing the medical relation prediction task based on expert knowledge. Secondly, I will introduce how we can learn better word representations based on commonsense knowledge and reasoning. Our proposed framework learns a commonsense reasoning module guided by a self-supervision task and provides word pair and single word representations distilled from learned reasoning modules. Both the above works are able to offer reasoning paths to justify their decisions and boost the model interpretability that humans can understand with minimal knowledge barriers.

**Bio:**Zhen Wang is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University advised by Prof. Huan Sun. His research centers on natural language processing, data mining, and machine learning with emphasis on information extraction, question answering, graph learning, text understanding, and interpretable machine learning. Particularly, he is interested in improving the trustworthiness and generalizability of data-driven machine learning models by interpretable and robust knowledge representation and reasoning. He has published papers in several top-tier data science conferences, such as KDD, ACL, WSDM as well as journals like Bioinformatics. He conducts interdisciplinary research that connects artificial intelligence with cognitive neuroscience, linguistics, software engineering, and medical informatics, etc.

**Talk Title:** Wide and Deep Networks Achieve Consistency in Classification

**Talk Abstract:** While neural networks are used for classification tasks across domains, a long-standing open problem in machine learning is determining whether neural networks trained using standard procedures are consistent for classification, i.e., whether such models minimize the probability of misclassification for arbitrary data distributions. In this work, we identify and construct an explicit set of neural network classifiers that are consistent. Since effective neural networks in practice are typically both wide and deep, we analyze infinitely wide networks that are also infinitely deep. In particular, using the recent connection between infinitely wide neural networks and Neural Tangent Kernels, we provide explicit activation functions that can be used to construct networks that achieve consistency. Interestingly, these activation functions are simple and easy to implement, yet differ from commonly used activations such as ReLU or sigmoid. More generally, we create a taxonomy of infinitely wide and deep networks and show that these models implement one of three well-known classifiers depending on the activation function used: (1) 1-nearest neighbor (model predictions are given by the label of the nearest training example); (2) majority vote (model predictions are given by the label of the class with greatest representation in the training set); or (3) singular kernel classifiers (a set of classifiers containing those that achieve consistency). Our results highlight the benefit of using deep networks for classification tasks, in contrast to regression tasks, where excessive depth is harmful.

**Talk Title:** Validity, equity, and oversight in societally consequential machine learning

**Talk Abstract:** Machine learning algorithms are widely used for decision-making in societally high-stakes settings from child welfare and criminal justice to healthcare and consumer lending. Recent history has illuminated numerous examples where these algorithms proved unreliable or inequitable. We take a principled approach to the use of machine learning in societally high-stakes settings, guided by three pillars: validity, equity, and oversight. We address data problems that challenge the validity of algorithmic decision support systems by developing methods for algorithmic risk assessments that account for selection bias, confounding, and bandit feedback. We conduct audits for bias throughout the systems in which algorithms are used to inform decision-making. Throughout we propose novel methods that use doubly-robust techniques for bias correction. We apply our methods to the consumer lending context where we find that use of our methods could extend lending opportunities to applicants from historically underbanked regions without an increase in the average rate of default. We present additional findings in the child welfare, criminal justice and healthcare settings.

**Talk Title:** Towards Risk-Aware Robotic Autonomy in Extreme Environments: Robustness to Distribution Shifts in Control and Planning

**Talk Abstract:** Robots provide the crucial ability to replace humans in environments that are inaccessible due to environmental hazards such as search and rescue operations. They need to be able to reason about the risk in an environment that is perceptually degraded and complete tasks while maintaining safety. Providing safety and performance guarantees for motion planning and control algorithms is a well-studied problem for robotic systems with well-known dynamics that operate in structured environments. However, when robots operate in a real-world setting where the environment is dynamic and unstructured, common distributional assumptions used to develop the planning algorithms are no longer valid and consequently, the safety guarantees no longer hold. In this talk, I will focus on risk-aware methodologies for robotic autonomy in unstructured environments. I will provide data-driven motion planning techniques to account for uncertainty in dynamic environments and sample-based risk bounds to provide high-confidence verification statements for robotic systems. The goal of the talk is to understand how robots interpret the ambiguity in their environment, and the ways to generate policies that better account for this uncertainty.

**Talk Title:** Adaptively Exploiting d-Separators with Causal Bandits

**Talk Abstract:** Multi-armed bandit problems provide a framework to identify the optimal intervention over a sequence of repeated experiments. Without additional assumptions, minimax optimal performance (measured by cumulative regret) is well-understood. With access to additional observed variables that d-separate the intervention from the outcome (i.e., they are a d- separator), recent “causal bandit” algorithms provably incur less regret. However, in practice it is desirable to be agnostic to whether observed variables are a d-separator. Ideally, an algorithm should be adaptive; that is, perform nearly as well as an algorithm with oracle knowledge of the presence or absence of a d-separator. In this work, we formalize and study this notion of adaptivity, and provide a novel algorithm that simultaneously achieves (a) optimal regret when a d-separator is observed, improving on classical minimax algorithms, and (b) significantly smaller regret than recent causal bandit algorithms when the observed variables are not a d-separator. Crucially, our algorithm does not require any oracle knowledge of whether a d-separator is observed. We also generalize this adaptivity to other conditions, such as the front-door criterion.

**Talk Title:** Challenges in Opinion Manipulation Detection: An Examination of Wartime Russian Media

**Talk Abstract:** Information warfare has been at the forefront of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war, as all sides attempt to shape online narratives. NLP could be valuable for combating manipulation, but most prior work focuses on detecting extreme manipulation strategies like fake news and relies on supervised approaches with pre-annotated data, which is unavailable in emerging crises. We release a new dataset, VoynaSlov, containing 38M+ social media posts from Russian media and their public responses. We characterize VoynaSlov along three dimensions: media ownership (state-affiliated, independent), platform (Twitter, VKontakte), and time (pre-war, during-war). Drawing from political communication, we investigate subtle manipulation strategies by applying state-of-the-art NLP models to quantify agenda-setting, framing, and priming. Our methodology includes word frequencies, topic modeling, supervised classification, and consideration of metadata such as likes or shares. Each technique reveals interesting, yet sometimes conflicting, insights; for example, independent outlets are more likely to use war-related words, but state-affiliated outlets discuss war-related topics more. Throughout the talk, we discuss numerous limitations: topic model interpretability and instability, unclear framing typologies and domain-specificity, and issues surrounding validity and misuse for priming. Our dataset, initial investigation, and discussion of open technical challenges can facilitate the identification and mitigation of information manipulation tactics in ongoing crisis situations.

**Talk Title:** Implicit bias of optimization algorithms for neural networks and their effects on generalization

**Talk Abstract:** Modern neural networks are usually over-parameterized—the number of parameters exceeds the number of training data. In this case the loss functions tend to have many (or even infinite) global minima, which imposes an additional challenge of minima selection on optimization algorithms besides the convergence. Specifically, when training a neural network, the algorithm not only has to find a global minimum, but also needs to select minima with good generalization among many other bad ones. In this talk, I will share a series of works studying the mechanisms that facilitate global minima selection of optimization algorithms. First, with a linear stability theory, we show that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) favors flat and uniform global minima. Then, we build a theoretical connection of flatness and generalization performance based on a common structure of neural networks. Next, we study the global minima selection dynamics—the process that an optimizer leaves bad minima for good ones—in two settings. For a manifold of minima around which the loss function grows quadratically, we derive effective exploration dynamics on the manifold for SGD and Adam, using a quasistatic approach. For a manifold of minima around which the loss function grows subquadratically, we study the behavior and effective dynamics for GD, which also explains the edge of stability phenomenon.

**Talk Title:** Digital Doubles of Everything (Even You)

**Talk Abstract:** Scientists have long made and interrogated doubles of reality. Often developed to describe narrow aspects of otherwise immense systems, traditional models have always been relatively poor substitutes for the bewildering tangle of complexity that pervades the world. However, the rise of AI allows scientists to generate and interrogate increasingly sophisticated digitized captures of entire systems of interest. These “digital doubles” represent everything from system I/O to complete characterizations of internal mechanisms and processes. In this project, we argue that the opportunity with doubles of many such systems is not just expedient exploration or accurate prediction. Instead, it is to combine them, represent interactions between them faithfully, and even enable them to interrogate and explore one another. We probe the possibility of developing digital doubles of dynamic systems of knowledge, values, and commitments, as well as using these doubles to operationalize and automate a logic of anomaly detection and correction, not only in our data but in our theoretical and normative, non-epistemic commitments.

**Talk Title:** Identifiable deep generative models via sparse decoding

**Talk Abstract:** We develop the sparse VAE for unsupervised representation learning on high-dimensional data. The sparse VAE learns a set of latent factors (representations) which summarize the associations in the observed data features. The underlying model is sparse in that each observed feature (i.e. each dimension of the data) depends on a small subset of the latent factors. As examples, in ratings data each movie is only described by a few genres; in text data each word is only applicable to a few topics; in genomics, each gene is active in only a few biological processes. We prove such sparse deep generative models are identifiable: with infinite data, the true model parameters can be learned. (In contrast, most deep generative models are not identifiable.) We empirically study the sparse VAE with both simulated and real data. We find that it recovers meaningful latent factors and has smaller heldout reconstruction error than related methods.

**Talk Title:** Understanding scientific fields via network analysis and topic modeling

**Talk Abstract:** As scientific disciplines get larger and more complex, it becomes impossible for an individual researcher to be familiar with the entire body of literature. This forces them to specialize in a sub-field, and unfortunately such insulation can hinder the birth of ideas that arise from new connections, eventually slowing down scientific progress. As such, discovering fruitful interdisciplinary connections by analyzing scientific publications is an important problem in the science of science. This talk will present several past and ongoing projects towards answering that question using tools from network analysis and topic modeling: 1) a dynamic-embedding-based method for link prediction in a machine learning/AI semantic network, 2) finding communities in cognitive science that study similar topics but do not cite each other or publish in the same venues, and 3) developing theoretically grounded hypergraph embedding methods to capture surprising collaborations or missed opportunities.

**Talk Title:** A Convolutional Neural Network Approach to Supernova Classification

**Talk Abstract:** One of the brightest objects in the universe, supernovae are powerful explosions marking the end of a star’s lifetime. Supernova type is defined by spectroscopic emission lines, but obtaining spectroscopy is often logistically unfeasible. Thus, the ability to identify supernovae by type using time-series image data alone is crucial, especially in light of the increasing breadth and depth of upcoming telescopes. We present a convolutional neural network method for fast supernova time-series classification, with observed brightness data smoothed in both the wavelength and time directions with Gaussian process regression. We apply this method to full duration and truncated supernova time-series, to simulate retrospective as well as real-time classification performance. Retrospective classification is used to differentiate cosmologically useful Type Ia supernovae from other supernova types, and this method achieves > 99% accuracy on this task. We are also able to differentiate between 6 supernova types with 60% accuracy given only two nights of data and 98% accuracy retrospectively.

**Talk Title:** Algorithmic Foundation of Fair Graph Mining

**Talk Abstract:** Graphs are ubiquitous in many real-world applications. To date, researchers have developed a plethora of theories, algorithms and systems that are successful in answering what and who questions on graphs. Despite the remarkable progress, unfairness often occurs in many graph mining algorithms, hindering the deployment of graph mining algorithms in high-stake applications. To make graph mining process and its results fair, it is crucial to propose a paradigm shift, from answering what and who to understanding how and why. Four desired properties (i.e., utility, fairness, transparency and robustness) are called for in order to build an algorithmic foundation of fair graph mining. In this talk, I will present our efforts in building the algorithmic foundation of fair graph mining by addressing the tensions among the desired properties. First, we present a generic algorithmic framework to understand how the graph mining results relate to the input graph. Second, we systematically study the individual fairness on graph mining, including the measurement, mitigation strategies and cost. Finally, we analyze the root cause of degree-related unfairness in graph neural networks and present a family of debiasing algorithms, followed by my thoughts about the future work.

**Talk Title:** Modeling and Correcting Bias in Sequential Evaluation

**Talk Abstract:** We consider the problem of sequential evaluation in applications such as hiring and competitions, in which an evaluator observes candidates in a sequence and assigns scores to these candidates in an online, irrevocable fashion. Motivated by the psychology literature that has studied sequential bias in such settings — namely, dependencies between the evaluation outcome and the order in which the candidates appear — we propose a natural model for the evaluator’s rating process that captures the lack of calibration inherent to such a task. We conduct crowdsourcing experiments to demonstrate various facets of our model. We then proceed to study how to correct sequential bias under our model by posing this as a statistical inference problem. We propose a near-linear time, online algorithm for this task and prove guarantees in terms of two canonical ranking metrics. We also prove that our algorithm is information theoretically optimal, by establishing matching lower bounds in both metrics. Finally, we show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the de facto method of naively using the rankings induced by the reported scores.

**Talk Title:** Advancing Network Monitoring and Operation with In-band Telemetry and Data Plane Programmability

**Talk Title:** Provable Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning: Efficiency and Robustness

**Talk Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success recently to deal with unknown environments and maximize some long-term cumulative rewards. Contemporary reinforcement learning has to deal with unknown environments with unprecedentedly large dimensionality. In order to fundamentally understand and improve the effectiveness of RL algorithms in high dimensions, a recent body of work sought to develop a finite-sample theoretical framework to analyze the algorithms of interest. My work belongs to this recent line of delineating the dependency of algorithm performance on salient parameters in a non-asymptotic fashion in different RL settings. Besides maximizing the expected total reward, perhaps an equally important goal—to say the least— for an RL agent is safety and robustness, especially in high-stake applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, clinical trials, financial investments, and so on. Inspired by the robustness requirement, in this talk, we introduce our work on distributional robust RL with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the distance, referring to the problem of learning an optimal policy that is robust to future environment perturbations. I will introduce our proposed robust RL algorithm, which to the best of our knowledge is the first near-optimal algorithm for this problem, which matches the minimax lower bound up to a polynomial factor of the effective horizon length.

**Talk Title:** Enabling Large-Scale Certifiable Deep Learning towards Trustworthy Machine Learning

**Talk Abstract:** Given the rising societal safe and ethical concerns for modern deep learning systems in deployment, designing certifiable large-scale deep learning systems for real-world requirements is in urgent demand. This talk will introduce our series of work on building certifiable large-scale deep learning systems towards trustworthy machine learning, achieving robustness against noise perturbations, semantic transformations, poisoning attacks, distributional shifts; fairness; and reliability against numerical defects. I will also present the applications of these certifiable methods in modern deep reinforcement learning and computer vision systems. These works are recently published at machine learning and security conferences such as ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, CCS, and S&P. Then, I will introduce the shared core backbone for designing certifiable deep learning systems, including threat-model-dependent smoothing, efficient and exact model state abstraction, statistical worst-case characterization, and diversity-enhanced model training. These backbone methodologies not only enable us to achieve the state-of-the-art certified trustworthiness under multiple existing notations and outperform existing baselines (if exists) with a large margin, but also indicate a promising direction towards achieving certified and “meta-trustworthy” ML. At the end of the talk, I will summarize several challenges in certifiable ML, such as scalability challenges, tightness challenges, deployment challenges, the gap between theory and practice, and the societal implications/impacts of certifiably trustworthy ML. The talk will be concluded with highlighted future directions for research and applications.

**Talk Title**: Semantic-Aware Robotic Mapping in Unknown, Loosely Structured Environments

**Talk Abstract**: Robotic mapping is the problem of inferring a representation of a robot’s surroundings using noisy measurements as it navigates through an environment. As robotic systems move toward more challenging behaviors in more complex scenarios, such systems require richer maps so that the robot understands the significance of the scene and objects within. This talk focuses on semantic-aware robotic mapping in unknown, loosely structured environments. The first part is a Bayesian kernel inference semantic mapping framework that formulates a unified probabilistic model for occupancy and semantics, and provides a closed-form solution for scalable dense semantic mapping. This framework significantly reduces the computational complexity of learning-based continuous semantic mapping and achieves high accuracy in the meantime. Next, I will present a novel and flexible multi-task multi-layer Bayesian mapping framework that provides even richer environmental information. A two-layer robotic map of semantics and traversability is built as a constructive example. Moreover, it is readily extendable to include more layers according to needs. Both mapping algorithms were verified using publicly available datasets or through experimental results on a Cassie-series bipedal robot. Finally, instead of modeling the terrain traversability using metrics defined by domain knowledge, an energy-based deep inverse reinforcement learning method that learns robot-specific traversability from demonstrations will be presented. This method considers robot proprioception and can learn reward maps that lead to more energy-efficient future trajectories. Experiments are conducted using a dataset collected by a Mini-Cheetah robot in various scenes of a campus environment.

**Talk Title:** Efficient data processing pipeline for IoT sensor devices in environmental monitoring networks.

**Talk Abstract:** Low-cost IoT sensors (LCS) have the capacity to provide high resolution spatio-temporal dataset of key variables in environmental monitoring networks. The use of LCS in environmental monitoring, however, continues to raise important questions, especially pertaining to the reliability, field performance and data quality of the sensors. IoT technologies are at the early stage of development in many application areas and as such they are still challenged by a number of issues including data handling and framework. There is currently no universal framework and/or formalized architecture in existence for the application of IoT sensor devices in environmental monitoring and no complete tool has been developed for data handling and analysis.

Developing effective data processing pipeline for IoT sensor data is essential for the adoption and application of LCS in environmental monitoring. In this talk, I will discuss our research efforts aimed at improving field performance and data quality of LCS devices in environmental monitoring networks, through the development of reliable data processing and error correction techniques such as automatic sensor calibration, data fusion, data imputation, outlier detection and effective feature selection.

I will discuss how the capabilities of AI/ML can be leveraged to support the effective application of IoT in ecological sensing. In particular, how these technologies can: 1.) support the operations of LCS in data acquisition models to capture large scale and longitudinal observations, 2.) support the development of specific data handling and Data Quality Improvement (DQI) techniques for LCS, and 3.) serve as effective strategies to support on-site sensor calibration.

**Talk Title:** The power and limitations of convex regularization

**Talk Abstract:** The incorporation of regularization functionals to promote structure for inverse problems has had a long history in applied mathematics, with a recent surge of interest in the use of both convex and nonconvex functionals. The structure of such functionals largely lies in computational and modeling considerations, but there is a lack of an overarching understanding of the power and limitations of enforcing convexity versus nonconvexity and when one should be used over another for a given data distribution. In this presentation, we propose to tackle this question from a convex geometric perspective and ask the following question: for a given data source, what is the optimal regularizer induced by a convex body? To answer this, a variational optimization problem over the space of convex bodies is proposed to search for the optimal regularizer. We analyze the structure of population risk minimizers by connecting minimization of the population objective to Minkowski’s inequality for convex bodies. These results are also shown to be robust, as we establish convergence of empirical risk minimizers to the population risk minimizer in the limit of infinite data. Based on this characterization of optimal convex regularizers, we then consider whether convexity is the right structure for certain distributions and use our theory to characterize when convex or nonconvex structure should be preferred.

**Talk Title:** AI for clinical trials and precision medicine

**Talk Abstract:** Clinical trials are the gate-keeper of medicine but can be very costly and lengthy to conduct. Precision medicine transforms healthcare but is limited by available clinical knowledge. This talk explores how AI can help both — make clinical trials more efficient and generate hypotheses for precision medicine.

**Talk Title:** Towards the Science of AI for Nonprofits

**Talk Abstract:** I work on AI for nonprofits, with nonprofits, so that it could be used by nonprofits. This talk is about delineating AI for nonprofits as a research discipline of its own. I will start with a 4-year collaboration with a food rescue organization. We developed a series of machine learning-based algorithms to help the organization engage with food rescue volunteers. Our tools have been deployed since February 2020. Our randomized controlled trial showed that the algorithm not only improved the accuracy of engagement, but also made it significantly easier for rescues to get claimed. We are rolling it out to over 15 cities across the US. Motivated by the pain points we experienced in this and other works, we proposed bandit data-driven optimization, a new learning paradigm that integrates online bandit learning and offline predictive models to address the unique challenges that arise in data science projects for nonprofits. We prove theoretical guarantees for our algorithm and show that it achieves superior performance on simulated and real datasets. I will conclude the talk with an inquiry of the state of AI for nonprofits as its own research discipline. Using another project where we developed and deployed an NLP tool for with a conservation nonprofit as a primer, I argue that AI for nonprofits needs its own set of research questions that will systematically guide future projects. I will share a few of these directions that I am currently working on and plan to work on in the near future.

**Talk Title:** Scalable and Trustworthy Learning in Heterogeneous Networks

**Talk Abstract:** Federated learning stands to power next-generation machine learning applications by aggregating a wealth of knowledge from distributed data sources. However, federated networks introduce a number of challenges beyond traditional distributed learning scenarios. In addition to being accurate, federated methods must scale to potentially massive and heterogeneous networks of devices, and must exhibit trustworthy behavior—addressing pragmatic concerns related to issues such as fairness, robustness, and user privacy. In this talk, I talk about how heterogeneity lies at the center of the constraints of federated learning—not only affecting the accuracy of the models, but also competing with other critical metrics such as fairness, robustness, and privacy. To address these metrics, I talk about new, scalable federated learning objectives and algorithms that rigorously account for and address sources of heterogeneity. Although our work is grounded by the application of federated learning, I show that many of the techniques and fundamental tradeoffs extend well beyond this use-case.

**Talk Title:** Modeling Ideological Language with Graph Neural Networks and Structured Sparsity

**Talk Abstract:** The increasing polarization of online political discourse calls for computational tools that automatically detect and monitor ideological divides in social media. While many methods to track ideological polarization have been proposed, most of them rely on knowing in advance the political orientation of text, a requirement seldom met in practice. In this talk, I will discuss research recently published at NAACL and ICML that fully dispenses with the need for labeled data and instead leverages the ubiquitous network structure of online discussion forums, specifically Reddit, to detect ideological polarization. I will first give an overview of prior research on polarization in natural language processing, highlighting salience and framing as two key mechanisms by which ideology manifests itself in language. I will then present Slap4slip, a method that combines graph neural networks with structured sparsity learning to determine the polarization of political issues (e.g., abortion) along the dimensions of salience and framing. In the third part of the talk, I will show that polarization is also reflected by the existence of an ideological subspace in contextualized embeddings, which can be found by adding orthogonality regularization to Slap4slip. The ideological subspace encodes abstract evaluative semantics and indicates pronounced changes in the political left-right spectrum during the presidency of Donald Trump.

**Talk Title:** Advancing Health Equity with Machine Learning

**Talk Abstract**: While a patient visits the hospital for treatment, factors outside the hospital, such as where the individual resides and what educational and vocational opportunities are present, play a vital role in the patient’s health trajectory. On the contrary, most advances in machine learning in healthcare are mainly restricted to data within hospitals and clinics. While health equity, defined as minimizing avoidable disparities in health and its determinants between groups of people with different social privileges in terms of power, wealth, and prestige, is the primary principle underlying public health research, this has been largely ignored by the current machine learning systems. Inequality at the social level is harmful to the population as a whole. Thus, a focus on the factors related to health outside the hospital is imperative to not only address specific challenges for high-risk individuals but also to determine what policies will benefit the community as a whole. In this talk, I will first demonstrate the challenges of mitigating health disparities resulting from the different representations of demographic groups based on attributes like gender and self-reported race. I will focus on machine learning systems using person-generated data and in-hospital data from multiple geographical locations worldwide. Next, I will present a causal remedial approach to health inequity using algorithmic fairness that reduces health disparities. In the end, I will discuss how algorithmic fairness can be leveraged to achieve health equity by incorporating social factors and illustrate how residual disparities persist if social factors are ignored.

**Talk Title**: The Back-And-Forth Method For Wasserstein Gradient Flows

**Talk Abstract**: We present a method to efficiently compute Wasserstein gradient flows. Our approach is based on a generalization of the back-and-forth method (BFM) introduced by Jacobs and Leger to solve optimal transport problems. We evolve the gradient flow by solving the dual problem to the JKO scheme. In general, the dual problem is much better behaved than the primal problem. This allows us to efficiently run large scale gradient flows simulations for a large class of internal energies including singular and non-convex energies. Joint work with Matt Jacobs (Purdue University) and Flavien Leger (INRIA Paris).

**Talk Title**: Market Manipulation: An Adversarial Learning Framework for Detection and Evasion

**Talk Abstract**: I will talk about our recently proposed adversarial learning framework that captures the evolving game between a regulator who develops tools to detect market manipulation and a manipulator who obfuscates actions to evade detection. The model includes three main parts: (1) a generator that learns to adapt a sequence of known manipulation activities to resemble patterns of a normal (benign) trading agent while preserving the manipulation intent; (2) a discriminator that differentiates the adversarially adapted manipulation actions from normal trading activities; and (3) an agent-based model that provides feedback in regard to the manipulation effectiveness and profitability of adapted outputs. We conduct experiments on simulated trading actions associated with a manipulator and a benign agent respectively. We show examples of adapted manipulation order streams that mimic the specified benign trading patterns and appear qualitatively different from the original manipulation strategy we encoded in the simulator. These results demonstrate the possibility of automatically generating a diverse set of (unseen) manipulation strategies that can facilitate the training of more robust detection algorithms.

**Talk Title**: Universality of regularized regression estimators in high dimensions

**Talk Abstract**: The Convex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT) has emerged as a prominent theoretical tool for analyzing the precise stochastic behavior of various statistical estimators in the so-called high dimensional proportional regime, where the sample size and the signal dimension are of the same order. However, a well recognized limitation of the existing CGMT machinery rests in its stringent requirement on the exact Gaussianity of the design matrix, therefore rendering the obtained precise high dimensional asymptotics largely a specific Gaussian theory in various important statistical models. This work provides a structural universality framework for a broad class of regularized regression estimators that is particularly compatible with the CGMT machinery. In particular, we show that with a good enough $\ell\_\infty$ bound for the regression estimator $\hat{\mu}\_A$, any `structural property’ that can be detected via the CGMT for $\hat{\mu}\_G$ (under a standard Gaussian design G) also holds for $\hat{\mu}\_A$ under a general design A with independent entries. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate our new universality framework in three key examples of regularized regression estimators: the Ridge, Lasso and regularized robust regression estimators, where new universality properties of risk asymptotics and/or distributions of regression estimators and other related quantities are proved. As a major statistical implication of the Lasso universality results, we validate inference procedures using the degrees-of-freedom adjusted debiased Lasso under general design and error distributions. We also provide a counterexample, showing that universality properties for regularized regression estimators do not extend to general isotropic designs.

**Talk Title**: How neural network learns representation: a random matrix theory perspective

**Talk Abstract**: Random matrix theory (RMT) provides powerful tools to characterize the performance of random neural networks in high dimensions. However, it is not clear if similar tools can be applied to trained neural network where the parameters are no longer i.i.d. due to gradient-based learning. In this work we use RMT to precisely quantify the benefit of feature learning in the “early phase” of gradient descent training. We study the first gradient step under the MSE loss on the first-layer weights W in a two-layer neural network. In the proportional asymptotic limit and an idealized student-teacher setting, we show that the gradient update contains a rank-1 “spike”, which results in an alignment between the weights and the linear component of the teacher model f\*. To understand the impact of this alignment, we compute the asymptotic prediction risk of ridge regression on the conjugate kernel after one feature learning step with learning rate \eta. We consider two scalings of \eta. For small \eta, we establish a Gaussian equivalence property for the trained features, and prove that the learned kernel improves upon the initial random features, but cannot defeat the best linear model. Whereas for sufficiently large \eta, we prove that for certain f\*, the same ridge estimator goes beyond this “linear regime” and outperforms a wide range of (fixed) kernels. Our results demonstrate that even one gradient step can lead to considerable advantage over random features, and highlight the role of learning rate scaling in the initial phase of training.

**Talk Title**: Machine Learning for Differential equations: Statistics, Optimization and MultiLevel Learning

**Talk Abstract**: In this talk, we aim to study the statistical limits and optimal algorithms to solve Elliptic PDEs from random samples. In the first part of my talk, I’ll study the statistical and optimization property of learning the Elliptic inverse problem using the Deep Ritz Method (DRM) and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). We provided a minimax lower bound for this problem and discovered that the variance in DRM leads sample complexity being suboptimal. Based on this observation, we proposed a modification of DRM with optimal sample complexity. Then I’ll introduce the optimization property of a class of Sobolev norms as the objective function. Although early stopped gradient descent for all the objective functions is statistically optimal, I observed that using the Sobolev norm can accelerate training. Combining the information from the two papers, we can conclude that DRM is fast for the high dimensional smoothing function due to the low computational cost of each iteration. But for low dimensional rough functions, we should use PINN. In the second part of my talk, I’ll talk about the statistical limit of learning linear operator learning, where both the input and output space are infinite-dimensional. We showed that proper bias and variance trade-offs could lead to optimal learning rates. The optimal learning rate is different from learning finite-dimensional linear operators. We also illustrate how this theory can inspire a multilevel machine learning algorithm. Our theory has wide application in learning differential operators and generative modeling.

**Talk Title:** Selective inference for k-means clustering

**Talk Abstract:** We consider the problem of testing for a difference in means between clusters of observations identified via k-means clustering. In this setting, classical hypothesis tests lead to an inflated Type I error rate. To overcome this problem, we take a selective inference approach. We propose a finite-sample p-value that controls the selective Type I error for a test of the difference in means between a pair of clusters obtained using k-means clustering, and show that it can be efficiently computed. We apply our proposal in simulation, and on hand-written digits data and single-cell RNA-sequencing data.

**Talk Title:** Model Criticism for Long-Form Text Generation

**Talk Abstract:** Language models have demonstrated the ability to generate highly fluent text; however, it remains unclear whether their output retains coherent high-level structure (e.g., story progression). Here, we propose to apply a statistical tool, model criticism in latent space, to evaluate the high-level structure of the generated text. Model criticism compares the distributions between real and generated data in a latent space obtained according to an assumptive generative process. Different generative processes identify specific failure modes of the underlying model. We perform experiments on three representative aspects of high-level discourse—coherence, coreference, and topicality—and find that transformer-based language models are able to capture topical structures but have a harder time maintaining structural coherence or modeling coreference structures.

**Talk Title**: Derandomized knockoffs: leveraging e-values for false discovery rate control

**Talk Abstract**: Model-X knockoffs is a flexible wrapper method for high-dimensional regression algorithms, which provides guaranteed control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Due to the randomness inherent to the method, different runs of model-X knockoffs on the same dataset often result in different sets of selected variables, which is undesirable in practice. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for derandomizing model-X knockoffs with provable FDR control. The key insight of our proposed method lies in the discovery that the knockoffs procedure is in essence an e-BH procedure. We make use of this connection, and derandomize model-X knockoffs by aggregating the e-values resulting from multiple knockoff realizations. We prove that the derandomized procedure controls the FDR at the desired level, without any additional conditions (in contrast, previously proposed methods for derandomization are not able to guarantee FDR control). The proposed method is evaluated with numerical experiments, where we find that the derandomized procedure achieves comparable power and dramatically decreased selection variability when compared with model-X knockoffs.

**Talk Title:** Machine learning for human learning

**Talk Abstract:** Despite the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, we have yet to witness the transformative breakthroughs that they can bring to education, and more broadly, to how humans learn. In this talk, I will introduce our two recent research directions in developing AI/ML methods to enable more personalized learning experiences on a large scale. First, I will describe generative modeling and representation learning techniques to enable adaptive learning materials, such as assessment questions and scientific equations, that are personalized to each learner. Second, I will describe a framework for analyzing learners’ open-ended solutions to assessment questions such as code submissions in computer science education. I will also discuss my vision for AI/ML methods for education and human learning, highlighting the fundamental technical challenges, my preliminary attempts, and their potential real-world impacts.

# Predicting Material Properties

Addressing the inherent complexities of materials science by developing a graph neural network to predict material properties.

Materials science, particularly in the realms of environmental sustainability and renewable energy, faces significant challenges due to its inherent complexity and the dynamic nature of research in this field. This complexity is amplified when it comes to functional nano-micro materials and devices, such as Field-Effect Transistors (FET) sensors and other cutting-edge applications.

UChicago postdoc researcher [Rui Ding](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/rui-ding/), along with Assistant Professor [Yuxin Chen](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/yuxin-chen/) and Professor [Junhong Chen](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/junhong-chen/), are working to address the complexities inherent in optimizing materials for applications such as FET sensors and beyond. The project seeks to transcend the current limitations of materials science research by fostering a comprehensive understanding and systematic optimization of nano-micro materials and devices. This network will not only leverage the data extracted but will also be enhanced with a fundamental knowledge graph of chemical elements and groups, enriching the data context.

This is not only crucial for enhancing the performance of existing materials but is also pivotal in discovering new materials with potential applications in various fields including renewable energy and environmental technology.

# Quantifying Social Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease

Corey Tabit, Marynia Kolak, and Elizabeth Tung

Physicians, epidemiologists, and spatial data scientists produce a new cardiovascular disease model that combines clinical and social risk factors.

Cardiovascular disease is the #1 killer of American adults. Preliminary data suggest that community social risk factors such as violent crime events, closures of food stores or pharmacies, and outages along critical mass transit lines are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events and worsened control of cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol. The project will determine how community stressors relate to cardiovascular events and develop a prediction model and a prototype software tool to identify patients at highest risk for cardiovascular events during their periods of peak risk, so that healthcare providers can more efficiently target interventions to the patients who need them most.

# Racial Inequality in Financial Resilience

Peter Ganong, Damon Jones, and Pascal Noel

Use data science to study how how households of different racial backgrounds cope with difficult economic shocks.

How do income instability and access to resources shape racial inequality? This project will use administrative data to construct the first estimates of financial resilience by race. Using anonymized data from millions of bank accounts to measure income and spending on a day-to-day basis, the researchers will study how households cope with difficult economic shocks such as job loss and measure financial resilience by whether household members cut back on grocery spending, skip doctors appointments, and miss bill payments. This project may uncover a new dimension of racial inequality, one with significant welfare and policy implications.

# Rational Protein Engineering using Data-Driven Generative Models

Andrew Ferguson, and Rama Ranganathan

Combine machine learning with high-throughput gene synthesis and rapid assay to learn nature’s rules for protein design and create synthetic proteins with elevated or new properties.

!Designing proteins to perform particular functions remains a grand challenge in modern science that has the potential to revolutionize medicine, public health, materials, and engineering. Directed evolution has enabled massive strides in discovering new proteins, but the vast size of potential sequences and random nature of mutations makes this process very inefficient.

Under a new paradigm, Profs. Andrew Ferguson and Rama Ranganathan employ artificial intelligence to learn “nature’s blueprint” for protein design using data-driven deep generative models. Through a continuous computational-experimental feedback loop, their platform mimics millions of years of evolution to discover and test new synthetic proteins with unprecedented function.

Design new “system-on-a-chip” hardware to help researchers in data-intensive fields monitor data quality and detect promising results without interrupting the flow of data

Machine learning on data is typically performed after it is gathered. But advances in real-time machine learning can analyze data on the fly, allowing scientists to quickly adjust experiments to capture phenomena of interest. That’s particularly appealing to researchers using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, where a single on-chip system can absorb multiple terabytes of data each second. [David Miller](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/david-miller/), associate professor of physics at UChicago, [Nhan Tran](https://nhanvtran.wixsite.com/home), Wilson Fellow at Fermilab, and [Andrew A. Chien](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/andrew-a.-chien), professor of computer science at UChicago, will collaborate on the design of new hardware that enables these advanced real-time processes. The resulting “system-on-a-chip” hardware design would help both high-energy physicists and researchers in other data-intensive fields monitor data quality and detect promising results without interrupting the flow of data.

# The Role of Rapid Bacterial Evolution in Human Health and Disease

A. Murat Eren, and Michael Yu

Apply machine learning to capture the diversity of plasmids in the microbiome, the rich population of microorganisms associated with humans and the natural environment.

The human body is home to an astonishing number of microbes, commonly referred to as the ‘microbiome’, which collectively encodes ten times more genes than the human genome itself. Although the human microbiome has been implicated in a multitude of diseases, the full set of biological mechanisms underlying these connections remain unexplored. This project will conduct a large-scale analysis of ‘plasmids’, small pieces of DNA that can be exchanged between different bacterial cells but are not part of the bacterial chromosome by employing the power of most recent high-throughput sequencing strategies and machine learning approaches to investigate relationships among plasmid genetics, microbial community structures, and human health.

Principal Investigators: Michael Yu (Research Assistant Professor, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago), A. Murat Eren (Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine)

# Understanding and Auditing Content Moderation Policies

Marshini Chetty, Chenhao Tan, Nick Feamster, and Genevieve Lakier

Combining computer science and law approaches to conduct an empirical study of the moderation policies and practices of popular social media platforms.

Internet and social media platforms face growing challenges in moderating the content posted by users, deploying a range of policies to find, flag, and remove offensive or inappropriate material. This study will combine computer science and law approaches to conduct an empirical study of the moderation policies and practices of platforms such as Youtube, Reddit, Facebook, and Etsy, creating the first public corpus of these policies and auditing how these systems are applied in real situations. The researchers will also conduct surveys and interviews to assess how users of these platforms perceive these policies and their expectations for how content rules will be enforced.

Principal Investigators: Marshini Chetty (Associate Professor, Computer Science), Chenhao Tan (Assistant Professor, Computer Science and Data Science), Nick Feamster (Neubauer Professor of Computer Science), and Genevieve Lakier (Professor of Law).

# Understanding Divergent Interpretations of Political Information

Yuan Chang Leong, and Daniel Grzenda

Using a combination of methods from neuroscience, linguistics, and computer science, to refine existing approaches for measuring political bias.

The current atmosphere of politically polarized media has strengthened individuals’ political bias in how they interpret news and other information. Using a combination of methods from neuroscience, linguistics, and computer science, this collaboration will refine existing approaches for measuring political bias. fMRI studies will measure the neural responses of conservatives and liberals while watching political debates, while natural language processing methods will build predictive models of the types of content that increase these divergent brain responses. The results will help create interventions that combat messaging designed to further inflame polarization, facilitating healthier political discourse.

# Using Field-Effect Transistor Array to Monitor Water Quality

Using a deep-learning approach to overcome the challenges in the sensing accuracy and reliability of field effect transistors sensors and achieve real-time monitoring of multiple nutrient ions simultaneously.

Determining nutrient levels is an important water quality factor in wastewater treatment and reclamation. In addition, recovery of nutrients from wastewater for fertilizer use could lead to significant energy savings and decarbonization of the fertilizer production industry while minimizing energy consumption and chemical usage for wastewater treatment. 

The growing demand for field-deployable, sensitive, and cost-effective sensors in nutrient monitoring has spurred extensive research into nanomaterial-based field-effect transistor (FET) sensors, driven by their distinct advantages in real-time detection, ultra low detection limits, miniaturized system, and digital readouts. However, real-world applications of these sensors suffer from batch variations, sample matrix effects and Debye length screening issues, which could severely impair the reliability of the device.

Graduate student [Wen Zhuang](https://pme.uchicago.edu/de-pablo-group/people/wen-zhuang), along with Professor [Junhong Chen](https://pme.uchicago.edu/faculty/junhong-chen) and [Dr. Haihui Pu](https://pme.uchicago.edu/junhong-chen-research-group/people/haihui-pu) are utilizing a deep-learning approach based on a multiplexed sensor array platform to overcome the challenges in the sensing accuracy and reliability of FET sensors and achieve real-time monitoring of multiple nutrient ions simultaneously.

HIGH SCHOOL DATA SCIENCE Study

# Student Voices

The data science students had a lot of insights about their experiences in the pilot classes. Here is what some of they had to say.

.padded-paragraph {padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;}.styled-heading {margin-bottom: 20px;color: maroon;}

## The Motivation: Why students enroll

#### **They wanted an alternative to traditional math classes.**

Some students enrolled because they had not liked or had not done well in math courses and wanted to have a different option.

#### **They were interested.**

Most students had not heard a lot about data science before, but some who had were excited to discover that a data science class was offered. Other students were excited by the opportunity to build their experience with, and knowledge of coding.

#### **They thought it would be useful.**

*“I’ve really always found math to kind of be something that I’ll never use in life. And now taking this class, I found that … with data science, it’ll be something that I could actually use.”*

#### **They wanted more preparation for future coursework.**

One student saw data science as a great course to take before taking AP Statistics as a senior while another thought data science could help them improve their ACT score in science.

#### **They thought it would be useful in their careers.**

*“I really like math and my teacher told me that it would be good for, like, if we wanted to run a business one day, and …I’m getting into business. So I thought it’d be interesting to take.”*

!

## The Course: Students’ favorite parts

#### **Interesting projects.**

Some students enjoyed projects that focused on data that was interesting to them, such as a project that helped them understand Spotify algorithms or another that looked at NBA data.

*“I really enjoyed the NBA player project. I thought that was pretty fun. I like looking at the data…I liked that …there was an end purpose in mind [and] it was almost a little bit of a competition.”*

Additionally, some students talked about writing letters to their senators.

*“It was very interesting writing the letters to the senators about all these little random topics. And* *then more recently, we started to get letters back from them. So that was really cool to get that* *letter. They actually took into account our little opinions on this.”*

#### **Coding and working with data.**

Other students enjoyed working with data generally, learning to code, and learning about machine learning.

*“I want to say [the best part of the class was] exploring machine learning for me. I really enjoy* *learning about stuff like that, especially because I want to be able to implement it and see how I* *can explore it and use it.”*

#### **Overall learning experience**.

Students enjoyed the structure of the course and appreciated getting to work on projects and activities during class, rather than spending the whole period listening to a lecture; and they loved getting to learn alongside their classmates and work in groups.

*“My favorite part was actually being able to do coding and all that with my friends and actually* *enjoying it with them.”*

## The Outcomes: Students’ perceptions of data science benefits

## 

#### **Learning about how to interpret, analyze, and present data.**

Many students felt that their biggest take away from the class was learning about data, how to interpret and analyze it, and how to read graphs. They also learned about the role data plays in the real world.

*“I remember we did this one lesson…about the CDC…[and] COVID…and I just* *remember [the teacher] saying that statistics have a real place in the world and how sometimes* *mistakes in them could cause mistakes to go on in the real world. I thought that was pretty* *interesting.”*

#### **Learning to be skeptical.**

Students appreciated knowing how to recognize if data is being presented in a biased way. One student explained,

*“I learned about having good graphs and when someone shows me information, like if they show me a 3D graph, I can say if it’s not very good or I can tell if they’re pushing an agenda or something.”*

#### **Learning to code.**

Students also spoke about gaining basic coding skills.

*“[Coding] was pretty difficult. Then once I knew how to do it, it was pretty fun.”*

#### **Learning to work together.**

Additionally, some students mentioned getting better at collaboration and working in groups.

*“[It was interesting] finding new things that we could learn together. You know, it’s better to* *learn with somebody else than just by yourself.”*

  Core

  * [Statistical Models for Data Science Letter Grade](#accordion-tab-0)

    In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.

  Core

  * [Leadership and Consulting for Data Science Letter Grade](#accordion-tab-0)

    Professional organizations see value in data science when it helps them to achieve their strategic goals, and the current job market likewise rewards data scientists who can use data to advance organizational interests, either as an external consultant or within internal operations teams. Data scientists can become successful (and highly marketable) leaders in today’s professional world, but they require an uncommon skill set: the strategic awareness to align data requirements with business requirements, the technical proficiency to choose a methodology appropriate to each new problem, and the communication skills to both execute the plan as part of a broader team and persuade others of their findings.
