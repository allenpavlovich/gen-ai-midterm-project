Daniel Truesdale, one of our own, started with the Coursera course “[Programming for Everybody Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python).” He also improved his skills through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) competitions.

In summary, you don’t need a technical background, but some familiarity with Python or R is important.

**Trait #2: Collaboration is Key**

Our students are ready to make an impact in tech, finance, sports, media, healthcare, education, government, logistics, and more. Moving from theory to real-world impact requires strong collaboration. We look for students who are:

* **Team Players**: Comfortable working with people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.
* **Community Builders**: Eager to join our community, help build it, and stay connected after graduation.

You’ll learn from our faculty and your classmates. Grad school is as much about building your network as it is about academics.

**Trait #3: Be Authentic**

Be yourself. We don’t expect you to be a master of math, statistics, and programming before you start—otherwise, you wouldn’t need us. Be open about areas where you want to grow, and proud of what you bring.

Authenticity helps us understand who you are and how you’ll contribute to our community.

If you’re considering applying, keep these traits in mind. We look forward to seeing what you’ll bring to the University of Chicago!

**Trait #4: Relax and communicate effectively**

Applicants must submit a video recording of themselves answering one question as part of the application; a second video prompt is optional. Practice presenting on camera and review your video before submitting. Speak clearly and calmly. We encourage you not to read from a script to avoid sounding robotic. This is your opportunity to showcase your personality and communication skills. Treat the video requirement as you would a job interview; professional attire is encouraged.

Presenting is common in our program. Don’t worry if your video isn’t perfect—there will be plenty of opportunities to practice during the program.

# Jan Mrozowski’s Path from Industry Professional to Teaching in the MS in Applied Data Science Program

For Jan Mrozowski (MSADS ‘19), the path to UChicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/) program was unexpected and initially unplanned. Originally from Eastern Europe and having lived in several countries, Mrozowski returned from Australia in late 2013 to start the next phase of his career in the United States. His first job offer with GE presented a unique opportunity. “I got three job offers, and all of them paid similar amounts of money, but GE told me that they pay 100% tuition at the school of my choice. So I was like, okay, and I joined GE and the University of Chicago at the same time,” he recalls, describing his entry into the newly launched program.

#### **Academic Beginnings and Real-World Experience**

With over a decade of experience in marketing analytics, Mrozowski was already familiar with data science when he entered the program. He established the Data Science function at Woolworths, Australia’s largest retailer, before the term “Data Science” was widely used, serving as Business Support Manager. Later, at GE, he led marketing analytics for the Sam’s Club credit card portfolio, further expanding his hands-on expertise. Although well-versed in analytics, the program helped him refine skills in areas such as data engineering and cloud computing. “That helped me a lot in my career since I joined the program,” he says. “It definitely improved some of my skills, especially in the area of data engineering and cloud computing.”

#### **The Accidental Teacher: From Student to Professor**

Mrozowski’s move into teaching was as unplanned as his entry into the program. While working with fellow students on an assignment, a group member—who also taught at another university—recognized his expertise and encouraged him to consider teaching. This led to his first teaching role at Benedictine University in Naperville while he was still a student. His passion for teaching grew from there. “When I was talking to professors at UChicago, they were like, ‘Why don’t you TA?’ So I thought, why not?” he shares.

This early teaching experience inspired him to pursue a PhD in economics in Poland, sponsored by the National Bank of his home country. Upon returning to Chicago, Mrozowski enrolled in a consulting class taught by [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/) and [Don Patchell](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/donald-patchell-mse-mba/), who were part of the new program leadership. He valued the insights and perspectives they brought, noting how the curriculum continued to evolve. Since then, Mrozowski has served as a TA for multiple UChicago [Applied Data Science courses](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/), including *Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics*, *Big Data and Cloud Computing*, and *Time Series Analysis and Forecasting*, among others. Reflecting on his experiences, he muses, “If I didn’t go to Europe, maybe I would be teaching by now as well.”

#### **A Love for Data Engineering**

Of the courses Mrozowski has TA’d, [Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/course-progressions/) stands out as his favorite. “I think data engineering is grossly underappreciated,” he explains. “Everybody’s focusing on model development, but it takes a lot of effort to prepare the data.” He shares an example from his current role as head of the risk department at Flex Shopper, where a recent intern was surprised by the complexity and time required for data preparation. “One piece of feedback she had was that she never understood how much time it takes to prepare the data for modeling.”

Mrozowski emphasizes that data engineering requires a deep understanding of data structures and access methods, which are essential for extracting and preparing data in the correct format. He sees it as a crucial foundation for success in the field. Whenever possible, he hires interns and employees from the program, recognizing their strong foundational skills and readiness for real-world challenges.

#### **Supporting Students Through Technical Challenges**

For Mrozowski, one of the most rewarding aspects of being a TA is helping students overcome technical challenges. “Being able to help students when they say, ‘Yes, it finally works,’” he says. Whether troubleshooting code or guiding students through difficult concepts, he takes pride in enabling their success. “You wouldn’t believe how much time I sometimes spend with data engineering students when there is a little-known issue,” he says. From ensuring compatibility with Apple’s latest processors to resolving cloud computing problems, his support often goes beyond the curriculum.

#### **Advice for New Students: Focus on Foundations and Networking**

When asked what advice he would give incoming students, Mrozowski stresses the importance of foundational courses. “Definitely pay more attention to data engineering and big data classes, because they will set you apart and prepare for success,” he advises. He also highlights networking, encouraging students to attend alumni events and build connections within the program’s professional network.

#### **Looking Ahead**

Mrozowski’s unconventional path through the MS in Applied Data Science program has led him to fulfilling roles as a TA, mentor, and leader in his field. His journey—spanning multiple countries and professional milestones—demonstrates the value of embracing unexpected opportunities. Mrozowski remains committed to supporting and inspiring students, reflecting his dedication to advancing the next generation of data science professionals.

The Summer Showcase featured projects across various industries, data types, and methodologies, with one team receiving special recognition.

“The quality of the work was truly impressive, and the teams deserve our congratulations for their hard work, professionalism, and commitment to excellence,” said [Greg Green](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/greg-green/), Director of the MS in Applied Data Science Program. “Their inventiveness was especially evident in the solutions they developed for their industry partners. We look forward to staying connected and hearing about the graduates’ future achievements.”

*Learn more about the winning project below.*

**[UChicago Medicine](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/) | Medical Language Processing – Patient Based Radiology Question & Answering System**  
**Presenters: Ananth Prayaga, Evelyn Wu, Nitin Gupta, Vivian Yeh**  
**Faculty Advisor: [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/)**

A major challenge in healthcare is effectively utilizing the vast amount of unstructured medical data available to professionals. Without a systematic and streamlined approach, reviewing patient information requires significant time that could otherwise be spent with patients.

For their [Capstone Project](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/), Ananth Prayaga, Evelyn Wu, Nitin Gupta, and Vivian Yeh addressed the labor-intensive task of reading radiology reports. They implemented a Closed Book Question-Answering (Q&A) System using the latest AI technologies to create an intelligent knowledge receiver, ContextualAI, capable of accurately answering queries without relying on external knowledge sources.

“A central area of development in the generative AI field involves using LLMs to ingest site- or institution-specific data that can then be queried,” the team says. “Hospitals, financial services companies, and law firms don’t want to share their internal data with OpenAI or other AI systems due to security and privacy reasons. Our task involved creating a framework using an LLM that could ingest and query local data without compromising privacy or security.”

Aiming to optimize workflow efficiency, increase productivity, and reduce physician burnout, the team tested existing Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases through various approaches as they developed their framework. Two main requirements guided their solution: ingesting the unstructured data of the partner institution and teaching the LLM a new skill to process that data.

Ultimately, the team achieved the best results using two of [Meta’s AI tools](https://ai.meta.com/), [Llama2](https://www.llama2.ai/) and [Faiss](https://faiss.ai/index.html), which generated answers with approximately 70% accuracy, validated using patient data and human evaluations.

“But we won’t stop there,” the team says. “This is a growing field and new models are being released every few weeks, so we will continue testing as new areas for improvement arise. Our client has already started to deploy our product and has expressed strong interest in further collaboration.”

The team also emphasizes the transformative potential of their project, noting its possible applications beyond healthcare. They point to a future where intelligent answers are just a question away.

“This is just the beginning of what is possible and we’re really excited to see it developed further to reach its maximum potential.”

# MS in Applied Data Science Students Present Research at National Conference

As Autumn Quarter 2023 concludes, here's a highlight from the MS in Applied Data Science community.

**Sampling Research**

Students in the MS-Applied Data Science program now have a research-focused option for their capstone experience. At a time when collaborations between industry and academia are essential for innovation and unlocking new value, applied data scientists are expanding their perspectives and deepening their skills by engaging with the research side of the discipline.

The University of Chicago’s [MS in Applied Data Science](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/how-to-apply/) has responded to this need by developing a new capstone track for students interested in research.

While the [capstone experience](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/ms-in-applied-data-science/capstone-projects/) has traditionally involved working with industry partners to solve real-world business problems, the research capstone allows students to collaborate with faculty on cutting-edge areas of data science where methodologies and applications are still being explored.

“The area of research is the key,” says [Utku Pamuksuz](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/people/utku-pamuksuz-phd/), an associate clinical professor at UChicago who led the development of the research capstone track. “We’re not conducting research on already well-studied areas but on the newest technologies where industry applications are still being worked out and discovered.”

The first set of research projects focused on generative AI, an area Pamuksuz says urgently needs research and offers many opportunities for students to gain experience in research design.

“Our goal is to be as up-to-the-minute as possible when it comes to teaching and sharing content with our students,” he says. “GenAI is an area still full of open questions, and we saw that a research-oriented approach—where faculty work directly with students as they review papers, conduct experiments, and present at academic conferences—would be the best way for students to understand these technologies at a fundamental level.”

**Connecting Academia to Industry**

Pamuksuz has bridged research and industry throughout his career. While earning his PhD in machine learning, he collaborated with professors in finance, marketing, and healthcare information systems to understand how these methodologies connect to other disciplines.

“You can do data science and use machine learning tools on virtually anything,” he says. “That’s what really caught my eye: The research side and the applied side are in constant dialogue.”

Having led data science teams at several Fortune 500 companies and co-founded the machine-learning company Inference Analytics, Pamuksuz continues to conduct research, attend conferences, and publish in journals. He says this experience benefits his teaching in the Applied Data Science classroom.

“I’ll show students how particular GenAI tools are being applied today, but then I’ll also highlight how the area is a live research area that’s still open to exploration and being looked at from various angles.”

For the first round of research projects, Pamuksuz and other faculty selected healthcare as the domain. With robust data sets, numerous potential use cases, and a positive social impact, healthcare provides students an ideal setting to understand and apply the foundational concepts behind the latest GenAI transformer models.

“Our goal was to work with students and get them to understand these models on the most basic levels, down even to figuring out what each single neuron is doing, how they interact, and the specific journey leading to the output. These areas are still very poorly understood today.”

**PhD-Lite Experience**

For their research capstone project, Andrew Alvarez, Mary Erikson, and Tegan Keigher explored the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate CT radiology reports.

With up to fifty percent of radiologists’ time spent drafting reports, transformer models that can automate this process have the potential to save time and reduce the stress contributing to burnout in recent years.

Starting their project in early 2023—just months after the release of ChatGPT—the team was eager to explore a timely and promising area.

“It’s been really incredible to focus on such a central topic in the world right now and dissect the nuts and bolts taking place inside it,” says Erikson, an analytical lead at Google.

“At first, the idea of building our own transformer model might’ve felt a little like we were biting off more than we could chew, but through reading key research papers, learning in class, and talking with each other and Utku, we were able to get a handle on this new area and connect it with what we’d learned already in the program.”

Alvarez, an engagement manager at United Airlines, says, “Doing something research-based gave us an entirely new experience, one that allowed us to pick up a different sort of skillset that’s still amenable to the workplace. It was something like a PhD-lite experience.”

“The capstone-related work has also helped me guide others taking their first steps into using transformer models,” Alvarez adds. “Automating areas that are putting a strain on our teams allows us to focus on the work that matters. That’s where I think these technologies will really shine.”

**Frontiers of Research**

A critical learning experience came when the team presented their research at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) during the [Conference on Machine Intelligence in Medical Imaging C[MIMI)](https://siim.org/learning-events/events/cmimi/).

This selective, research-focused conference gave them the chance to interact with top experts and see firsthand what is happening at the frontiers of research. Perhaps most significant were the questions the team received after their presentation.

“They asked us if we’d tried this approach, or looked at it in this way, or pre-processed data in that way,” says Keigher, a lead data scientist at United Airlines. “Learning about these other purely research-based approaches sparked ideas for us and got us thinking about how we could improve our project and test out different avenues.”

The team is now deepening their project by incorporating what they learned at the conference. Once they finalize their results, they plan to submit their work to the ultimate research test: a peer-reviewed publication.

Panic early (that is, when you get the assignment) rather than waiting to panic until the day before it’s due.

Core

* Statistical Models for Data Science Letter Grade  
  In traditional linear models, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response is a linear combination of predictors. Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) developed this framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been standard in statistics and data science for nearly two centuries. New methods based on other probability distributions emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century, enabling analysis of variables across broader domains and distributions. Additionally, new methods for analyzing general associations beyond Pearson correlation were developed.

* Leadership and Consulting for Data Science Letter Grade  
  Organizations value data science when it advances their strategic goals, and the job market rewards data scientists who can use data to support organizational interests, either as external consultants or within internal teams. To become successful and marketable leaders, data scientists need strategic awareness to align data and business requirements, technical proficiency to select appropriate methodologies, and communication skills to execute plans as part of a team and persuade others of their findings.
